<title>Si Maya at ang Kanyang Mga Kaibigang Hayop sa Gubat</title><body>
Si Maya, isang batang babaeng may buhok na kulay kayumanggi na parang gintong trigo, ay mahilig gumala sa kagubatan malapit sa kanyang tahanan.  Hindi lamang ang mga malalaking puno at mga malawak na damuhan ang kanyang kinagigiliwan, kundi pati na rin ang mga kaibigang hayop na kanyang nakikilala sa mga lilim at sa pagitan ng mga dahon.

Isang araw, habang naglalakad si Maya sa landas na may mahabang damuhan at banayad na hangin, narinig niya ang isang mahina at maamong tunog.  "Meow?" parang umaasang nagmamakaawa ang tunog.  Tumigil si Maya at pinagmasdan ang paligid, at sa ilalim ng isang matangkad na puno ng mangga, nakita niya ang isang maliit na pusa na may puting balahibo na animo'y natabunan ng niyebe.

"Hoy, maliit na pusa," tawag ni Maya.  Lumapit siya, at pinagmasdan ang pusa na nag-aalinlangan kung lalapit sa kanya.  "Wag kang matakot," bulong ni Maya.  "Ako si Maya. Gusto mo ba ng isda?"

Ang maliit na pusa, na ang pangalan ay napansin ni Maya, ay si Puso. Hindi pa nagsasalita si Puso.  Kaya ganoon ang pangalan.  Pinagmamasdan niya si Maya na parang natutuklasan ang isang misteryoso at kakaibang bagay. Nang biglang lumipad isang paru-paro na mas maliwanag pa sa araw!

Hindi nagtagal, naglalaro na ang dalawa. Pinagmasdan ni Maya si Puso na gumagawa ng mga nakakatawang paggalaw, sumisigaw ng maliliit na "meow" at nagpapantasya sa mga kakaibang hayop. Bigla siyang nagpatay-malisya, at nagpaikut-ikot habang naaapakan ang mga bulakabuko. Tumingin siya kay Maya. Parang nagsasabi sa kanyang isip, "Nakilala ko na ang taong ito."

Maya's pangalan ay nagsimula na niyang makalimutan at tuwang tuwa na siya ay malapit kay Puso. Parang ang pusa ay isang tunay na kaibigan na dapat niyang tagpuan sa kalagitnaan ng kagubatan. Nag-uusap ang kanilang mga katawan na hindi sumasalita. Nagbibigay ang isa sa isa ng mapagtiwalaang mga pagmamahal.

Maya soon noticed that there was a playful chatter in the undergrowth of the forest. "Hello," she called out in a playful manner. A fluffy, orange squirrel with eyes like glittering beads peeked out from behind a giant fern. "Hello, Maya," chirped the squirrel, "My name is Nutsy.  And that's not my real name. My mother named me that when I had nut-like cheeks as a baby."

Maya laughed.  "It suits you, Nutsy." She shared some of the sweet fruits that she had in her bag and the two quickly bonded. Nutsy told tales of the mischievous monkeys that played hide-and-seek among the trees, and of the wise old owl who seemed to know every secret of the forest.

As Maya walked on, she noticed a soft chirping sound emanating from a thick patch of thorny bushes. A small, timid bird with feathers the colour of rose gold trembled slightly.  "I'm afraid," the bird whispered. "The squirrels kept mocking me. They told me I am a sickly and pale bird".

"Don't be afraid," said Maya, comforting the tiny bird. "My name is Maya.  I'm not a mocking bird, but I am a friend who understands". Maya spoke softly to the bird, calming its fears and soon Rosebud, as she named the bird, began to trust Maya. Maya listened to Rosebud’s stories about the colourful butterflies she used to chase through the sky, tales filled with magic and wonder. 

The forest, at that time, held secrets and dreams. The warmth of the sun beamed down, chasing away the lingering shadows, inviting Maya and her animal friends to continue exploring and playing. Maya, Puso, Nutsy, and Rosebud spent the afternoon exploring the magical paths of the forest, creating joyful memories as their laughter echoed through the trees. They discovered hidden waterfalls, tasted sweet berries, and admired the shimmering beauty of dew-covered leaves.

Days turned into weeks, and Maya's bond with her animal friends grew stronger. She learned their languages—the soft meows of Puso, the chattering of Nutsy, the chirping of Rosebud, even understanding the rustling whispers of the forest itself.  Together, they navigated the maze of towering trees, explored the secrets of whispering glades, and felt the rhythmic beat of the forest’s heartbeat. Maya learned how to listen to the trees and understood the songs of the wind and the earth. 

Maya knew she was part of something wonderful.  She was a friend of the forest.


  One sunny morning, as Maya was leaving, she noticed a small, worried-looking deer standing near the entrance.  "What is it, little one?" she asked gently. The deer, with big, soulful eyes, trembled.  Maya quickly realised the deer was scared of something. With the help of Nutsy, Puso, and Rosebud, they discovered that a hunter was lurking in the nearby bushes, hunting for the forest animals.

Maya gathered her animal friends. Together, they surrounded the deer, offering it comfort and assuring the terrified animal that everything would be alright. They used their combined voices, and a series of powerful yet soothing noises to drive away the hunter.

And so, Maya and her animal friends protected the peace and harmony of the forest.  They lived happily ever after, cherishing their friendships and playing under the boughs of the tall trees. Their laughter and joyful noises resonated into the depths of the forest, keeping its secrets safe and making every creature happy for its unique voices.
