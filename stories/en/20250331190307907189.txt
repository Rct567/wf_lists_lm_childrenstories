<title>The Excellent Programmer Making Apps and Website.</title>
<body>
"Wake up, Timmy! Wake up, Lily! It’s a special day!" chirped a tiny voice.

Timmy groaned and burrowed further under his covers. Lily, however, blinked her eyes open. "Mmmph? Who's there?" she mumbled.

"It's Pip! And guess what? Today's the day!" The voice, now clearly recognizable as Pip, their pet Pixie, bounced excitedly on Lily’s bedside table.

Lily sat up, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "The day for what, Pip?"

"The day we visit Mrs. Higgins and learn about coding!" Pip exclaimed, his wings a blur of shimmering light.

Timmy, finally roused by the mention of something interesting, sat up too. "Coding? Like, computers?"

"Exactly!" Pip zipped around the room, leaving a trail of glittering dust. "Mrs. Higgins is the best programmer in the whole wide world! She makes apps and websites! Think of all the fun we can have!"

"Apps and websites?" Lily repeated, her eyes widening. "Like, those games on my tablet?"

"And the websites you use to watch your favorite cartoons!" Pip added. "It's all thanks to coding!"

“Wow!” Timmy exclaimed, suddenly fully awake. "Can we really learn to do that?"

"Of course! Mrs. Higgins loves teaching children. Get dressed quickly! I've already told her we're coming!" Pip instructed, his voice taking on a slight tone of bossiness.

Both children scrambled out of bed, buzzing with anticipation. After breakfast and brushing their teeth (Pip, thankfully, helped with the toothbrush by zipping it back and forth across their teeth with his pixie magic, saving them time), they were ready.

Mrs. Higgins lived in a colourful house at the edge of the woods. Her house was covered in vibrant paintings and had a huge window with a magnificent view. It was decorated with quirky, fun gadgets. As they approached, they saw Mrs. Higgins, a woman with bright, friendly eyes and a head of wild, curly hair, standing in her doorway.

"Welcome, Timmy, Lily, and Pip!" she greeted them with a warm smile. "Come in, come in! I'm so glad you could make it!"

Inside, the house was even more fascinating. Computers of all shapes and sizes were scattered around, along with screens, wires, and colourful building blocks. Books about code lay open on tables, and various robots were scooting and whirring across the floor.

"This is amazing!" Timmy gasped.

"This is my workspace," Mrs. Higgins explained, gesturing around. "Where I build things! And today, I'm going to show you how it all starts."

She led them to a large, comfy sofa. "Now, coding, at its simplest, is just giving instructions to a computer," she began. "Think of it like this: you're telling the computer what to do, step by step. And these instructions are called 'code'."

"So, like, if I want the robot to pick up that block," Timmy said, pointing to a colourful building brick, "I have to tell it how?"

"Precisely!" Mrs. Higgins beamed. "Let's use this as our first exercise. Here's a simplified programming language, a set of commands the robot can understand. Let's write the code for it."

Mrs. Higgins showed them a sheet with simple commands like `forward()`, `backward()`, `turn_left()`, `turn_right()`, `pick_up()`, and `drop()`.

“Okay," she said, handing each of them a piece of paper and a pencil. "Write the code to make the robot go to the block, pick it up, and then bring it to this designated spot."

Timmy and Lily stared at the block and the designated spot, thinking hard.

"Hmm," Lily said. "First, we need to tell it to go forward, right?"

"Right!" Mrs. Higgins nodded encouragingly.

Lily wrote: `forward()`

"And then...?" Timmy mused. "Then it's in front of the block, so we need to make it `pick_up()` the block, obviously."

"Perfect! " Mrs. Higgins said proudly.

Timmy then scribbled, `pick_up()`

"Now, the robot is holding the block," Pip said. "It needs to `backward()` to the designated spot."

After several more instructions were carefully written, they were both done. Mrs. Higgins guided them to her advanced robot, and they entered their created code step by step. The children held their breath. Then they hit 'Start'!

Slowly, a bit clumsily at first, the robot rumbled to life. It moved `forward()`, it stopped in front of the block and `pick_up()` and went `backward()`. Successfully, the robot reached the final spot and the action concluded in a satisfied `drop()`.

"Wow!" Lily and Timmy cheered, clapping. "We did it!"

"You did indeed!" Mrs. Higgins chuckled. "That’s the fundamental core of coding: Breaking a task down into small steps, and getting the machine to complete those steps."

Mrs. Higgins then showed them a different example to demonstrate coding for building a very simple website, using something called HTML.

“HTML is the language websites speak” Mrs. Higgins began, “If the Robot is the 'hardware,' HTML is like the 'software.' HTML uses special tags to make websites. For instance, there's the tag `<h1>` for titles, like your first project, let’s make a web site named 'Welcome to the Forest'"

"So how is it?" asked Timmy with much interest.

"It's really not complicated", Mrs. Higgins began, showing the text in HTML. "Here, if you wish for the web site to make a title in bold 'Welcome to the Forest'.

`<h1> Welcome to the Forest</h1>`
"Wow! So easy!" both the children reacted at the same time

"Of course you would want to include some text and content under the title", continued Mrs. Higgins.
"For that we will use the paragraph tag".
`Welcome to the Forest. We hope you enjoy this website.`
Now let's make it better, how about the website featuring two columns.

For this, we use CSS style tag with columns.
"Here" ,Mrs. Higgins opened another document and started writing.

`<style>
 .column {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
</style>
<h1> Welcome to the Forest</h1>
<div class = "column">
  <p> welcome the world!</p>
  <p> It is such a lovely sight</p>
 </div>
<div class = "column">
  <p>Hello World </p>
   <p>It is so bright!</p>
</div>
`

"Then"Mrs. Higgins continued, "we can include some interactive content to engage the users. So let's try this to make some boxes"

`<button onclick="myFunction()">Click Me</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello World!");
}
</script>`
"Click the button and you see, this is interactive."
"Can we make other things!" asked Timmy,
"Of course. You can add different contents with different languages" Mrs Higgins.
Mrs. Higgins helped them build a simple webpage featuring pictures of trees and animals. Timmy and Lily both got a taste of coding a simple web app, by building it themselves!

They played with the codes together and added content with the use of their knowledge and creative minds. Finally they also designed some basic animations and button function to complete their webpage project. Both children were very delighted as they felt that coding, though a little confusing at times, can actually be fun and interesting!

As the day wore on, they explored more advanced coding concepts like loops, variables, and if-then-else statements (which Mrs. Higgins explained by using analogies with playing games and ordering things). They learned that coding involved solving problems, being creative, and, most importantly, never being afraid to make mistakes. They also experimented with building basic mobile apps, using a special drag-and-drop coding system to bring their imaginations to life.

By the time the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, their heads were buzzing with new knowledge.

"I want to build my own game one day," Lily declared, her eyes sparkling.

"And I want to make an app that can talk to robots!" Timmy added excitedly.

"That is amazing!" Pip said as he floated next to the two friends. "But your creativity won't work without teamwork."

"You both have an incredible journey ahead," Mrs. Higgins smiled, watching their enthusiasm. "Remember, coding is a tool. A way to bring your ideas to life. You both did very well today, in both coding and creative thinking"

She patted each of them on their heads and gave them the certificate with a seal to mark this special event and a thank you note,

"Thank you, Mrs. Higgins!" both the children shouted in a unified voice.

As they walked home, hand in hand with Pip zipping happily between them, both Lily and Timmy talked and imagined how the exciting adventure, making fun apps and websites, was really wonderful, as they promised to put what they learned in good use. They decided to create their own simple game and show off to everyone else!
