<title>Oscar's Ride on a Rainbow Slide</title><body>Oscar lived in a world painted in soft blues and greens. His house, nestled beside a babbling brook, had walls the colour of ripe peaches and a roof that looked like spun sugar. But more than the colours, Oscar loved the sounds: the whisper of the wind through the weeping willows, the gurgle of the brook as it tumbled over smooth stones, and most of all, the cheerful chirp of the robin who nested in the apple tree just outside his window.

Oscar wasn’t like the other children in the village. He didn't laugh as loudly, or play as rough, and he always seemed to have a thoughtful frown etched on his small, round face. This was because Oscar had a secret. He missed his Mum.

Mum had gone to the sky a year ago, like a beautiful, silver bird. Oscar's Papa, his face always shadowed with a gentle sadness, had told him that Mum was now amongst the stars, twinkling and watching over him. But watching over him didn’t feel quite the same as her hugs, her smell of warm bread and cinnamon, or her bedtime stories with their silly voices and happy endings.

Every morning, Oscar would tiptoe into his Papa’s workshop, a cosy space filled with the scent of wood shavings and varnish. He’d perch on a small stool and watch as Papa carved wooden animals. He would help with the small, less complex details. Sometimes Papa would let him paint a tiny butterfly onto a giraffe’s nose, or put a bright red bow on a wooden rabbit. These were the moments Oscar felt closest to his Mum; she’d always loved art and crafts.

One particularly grey morning, when the sky wept tears of rain, Oscar felt a lump in his throat bigger than the biggest, knottiest apple. He missed his Mum so much that he could hardly breathe. He wandered to the window and watched the rain drumming on the glass. The world looked washed out, the colours muted and sad.

He felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. Papa stood behind him, his face lined with a worry Oscar knew all too well. "Feeling a bit gloomy today, eh, little sprout?" Papa said, his voice as warm and comforting as a summer's day.

Oscar nodded, his lower lip trembling. He didn't need to say the words; Papa always knew.

Papa knelt beside him, his blue eyes meeting Oscar's. “Sometimes,” he said softly, “when we miss someone very much, it can feel like the world is a little grey too. But even on the greyest days, the sun still shines behind the clouds.”

He reached out and took Oscar’s hand, his rough fingers surprisingly gentle. “Come on,” Papa said. “Let’s go for a walk.”

Outside, the rain continued to fall. Oscar, bundled up in his yellow raincoat, reluctantly followed his Papa. They walked along the muddy path that bordered the brook, the wind whipping at their clothes. Normally, Oscar would have loved this path, the smells of damp earth and blossoming wildflowers were normally delightful to his young senses, but today he just felt melancholy.

As they walked, Papa began to tell a story. It was a story about a boy who missed his Mum, a boy who felt the world was dark and dreary. Papa wove a tale of magical colours, of hidden pathways, and of a shimmering, rainbow slide.

"The rainbow slide," Papa explained, "is a special kind of slide. It appears only when someone is feeling a bit sad. It takes you on a journey, right through the clouds, where you can find joy again, or perhaps, just maybe, glimpse someone you miss."

Oscar listened, captivated. He could picture it: a giant, glistening slide of all the colours, curving and swirling, reaching up towards the grey sky. But as he pictured it, Oscar couldn't shake the feeling it was a fantasy.

Suddenly, the rain began to ease. The grey softened, and, slowly, the sun began to peek through the clouds. Then, something magical happened. A single, perfect rainbow arced across the sky, its colours brilliant and bold. It stretched from one side of the valley to the other, and where it touched the earth, a shimmering, shimmering shape seemed to materialize.

It was a slide. A rainbow slide.

Oscar gasped, his eyes wide with wonder. He looked at Papa, whose face was illuminated with a mixture of wonder and love.

“I don’t believe it,” Oscar breathed, his voice barely a whisper.

Papa simply smiled. “The slide is ready, little sprout.”

Hesitantly, Oscar began to walk towards the shimmering colours. As he drew closer, the colours became more intense, almost blinding. He could feel a strange tingling sensation in his toes. The rain had stopped completely, replaced by the gentle warmth of the sun.

He saw steps made of shimmering pearls leading up to the top of the slide. With Papa at his side, Oscar slowly ascended the stairs. As they reached the top, the view took Oscar’s breath away. He felt like he could touch the clouds; vast, fluffy pillows stretched out across the horizon, the land below like a patchwork quilt.

Taking a deep breath, he looked at his Papa.

“Go on, little sprout,” Papa encouraged, his voice filled with love. “Your Mum will be there to greet you.”

Trembling with anticipation and a touch of fear, Oscar took his seat on the rainbow. The surface felt strangely smooth, almost silky. He could see the whole valley stretching beneath him, a landscape of bright greens and cheerful reds, a world washed anew.

He pushed off and started his descent.

He whooshed down the slide, a glorious, exhilarating ride through the air. Each colour of the rainbow swept over him: the vibrant red, the sunny yellow, the calming blue, the brilliant green. He spun and twirled, giggling uncontrollably as he felt weightless. The world transformed to an utter blaze of colour.

As he neared the end of the slide, a soft, gentle glow began to surround him. He saw a meadow filled with flowers the colours he’d never dreamed of. And there, standing beneath a shimmering willow tree, he saw her.

His Mum.

She was bathed in the light, her hair glowing like spun gold. She wore a dress the colour of summer sunshine, and her eyes, the kindest, warmest eyes in the world, sparkled with love.

Oscar stumbled to his feet and ran towards her.

“Mum!” he cried, his voice filled with tears and joy.

She opened her arms, and he ran into them. The warmth of her embrace, the smell of sunshine and flowers, filled him with a profound peace he'd longed for.

“I missed you so much,” he sobbed.

“I know, sweetheart,” she whispered, stroking his hair. “But I’m always with you, you know. Right here.” She touched his heart. “And look around you, this place has been created for you. It's all filled with love, just like you.”

They spent what felt like forever together. Oscar showed her all of the wooden animals he helped Papa make. She helped him build a magnificent sandcastle in a small, glittering pond and together they played games, laughed, and talked about everything and nothing.

The sun began to sink in the sky and the colours started to softly fade, he felt himself being gently pulled away. She hugged him again, her presence warm in his heart.

“Remember,” she said, her voice filled with love, “the colours are always there, Oscar. They are inside of you, and around you. All you have to do is look, and sometimes, they’ll show you the way.”

As he reached the end of the meadow, his vision gently faded, and he felt himself gliding down a tunnel made of a thousand of colours. And then he was back.

He sat, blinking, at the bottom of the rainbow slide, the colours slowly fading back into the grey of the valley, just as the sun began to set, casting shadows all around. Papa was waiting for him, his eyes shining with happiness.

“Well, little sprout?” Papa asked gently.

Oscar couldn't stop smiling. The sadness, the grey, had gone. Replaced with warmth and joy. "It was amazing, Papa," he whispered. "The most amazing thing ever.”

Papa held his hand tightly. "I know, my sprout. I know."

As they walked home, the sky began to display another beautiful picture show with shades of orange, red and yellow. Oscar reached for Papa’s hand, and he knew in his heart that even though he couldn’t see his Mum with his eyes, she was with him. He carried the colours of the rainbow inside him, a shimmering reminder that even on the greyest of days, hope and love could always shine.

That night, tucked in his bed, Oscar closed his eyes. He could still feel the soft, gentle touch of his Mum's hand in his. And he knew, with a certainty that warmed him to the very core of his being, that his ride on the rainbow slide had brought him something extraordinary. The knowledge that she was, and would always be, just a thought away. He had the beautiful gift of love with him forever, and with his father to guide him on, he could begin to enjoy all of the colours that this great world had to offer. He drifted to sleep and dreamt, not of missing, but of love, of colour, and of his Mum's ever-present, radiant smile. He dreamt of rainbows.
