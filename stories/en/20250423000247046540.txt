<title>Poppy's Perfectly Peaceful Pony Ride</title>
<body>
Poppy loved Tuesdays. Tuesday was Pony Day. Every Tuesday, come rain or shine, Poppy’s parents drove her to the Whispering Woods Riding School. She would carefully select a pony for her riding lesson. Sometimes she chose Twinkle, a palomino pony with a golden mane and tail, known for her gentle nature. Other times, if she was feeling brave, she might select Blaze, a fiery chestnut pony, who was speedy and loved to gallop. But this particular Tuesday was different.

Poppy felt a familiar flutter of excitement in her tummy as they drove through the winding lane leading to the riding school. She could see the tops of the trees from the whispering woods peaking above the distant hill. But today, a shadow seemed to have fallen over the world. The sun wasn’t shining as brightly, and even the leaves on the trees seemed to droop with a certain kind of sadness.

As they parked, Poppy’s mother turned to her. "Poppy-Pip, your grandfather... he isn't very well. We might need to go straight from the riding school to the hospital. Are you okay with that?"

Poppy nodded slowly. Her grandfather, a jolly man with twinkling blue eyes and a long, white beard, was very special to her. He always had a warm smile, a joke, and a handful of peppermints for her. He loved to tell her stories about the Whispering Woods, about the magical creatures he said lived there. He always knew exactly how to make her laugh, and she couldn't imagine a world without him.

"Of course, Mummy," she whispered. "Let's have our ride."

They got out of the car, and Poppy’s father hugged her, a long and lingering hug. Poppy could feel the worry emanating from him, and the knot in her own stomach tightened.

The riding school was bustling. Children in colourful riding helmets and boots ran around, calling out to each other and helping to get the ponies ready. Poppy, though, felt disconnected. She walked into the stables, her usually bright and inquisitive eyes, shadowed by a sense of foreboding.

Her riding instructor, Mrs. Willowbrook, a kind woman with a gentle face and twinkling eyes, noticed her. “Poppy, darling, what ails you?”

Poppy swallowed hard, blinking back the tears that threatened to spill. "Grandpa… he’s sick," she mumbled.

Mrs. Willowbrook knelt down, putting her arm around Poppy. "Oh, Poppy-Pip. I know how much you love your grandfather. Shall we choose a particularly calming pony today? A pony to share your sadness?"

Poppy nodded again, her bottom lip trembling. “Yes, please.”

They walked through the stalls together. Usually, Poppy's eyes would light up at the sight of the ponies. But today, all she felt was the crushing weight of worry. Mrs. Willowbrook stopped in front of a stall she hadn’t noticed before. Inside, a beautiful, silver-grey pony was standing calmly. His coat shimmered in the dim light of the stable, and his large, dark eyes were filled with a gentle sadness that mirrored Poppy’s own.

"This is Cloud," Mrs. Willowbrook explained, her voice soft. "He's new. He's a very gentle pony, Poppy. He also seems to understand sadness better than anyone. Maybe you could tell him all your worries?"

Cloud looked at Poppy with a quiet patience. Poppy, with a slight shudder, thought that his very presence could soothe her sadness. He truly felt like a friendly and loving giant. Poppy’s eyes widened with awe and, finally, some quiet peace.

Cloud allowed Poppy to groom him, his coat soft and velvety beneath her hands. As she brushed his mane, she whispered to him about her grandfather, about the stories he used to tell, and the way his laugh used to echo through the halls of his cosy cottage. She told Cloud about how much she loved him, and about her fears that he wouldn't get better.

When it was time for the ride, Mrs. Willowbrook helped Poppy mount Cloud. She found, with a sudden surprise, that he was as gentle as a feather on her heart. He was solid and reliable beneath her, his movement like a gentle rocking motion. They walked slowly around the arena, Cloud never pulling or rushing, his gait mirroring Poppy’s own quiet stillness.

Poppy leaned forward, resting her cheek against Cloud's soft neck. She started humming a simple tune, a melody her grandfather used to sing to her when she was little. Cloud seemed to understand, his steady rhythm and slow pace giving Poppy time to allow her own thoughts to gently unfurl.

"Grandpa loves horses," Poppy murmured, her voice a shaky whisper. "He used to tell me stories about horses with magical wings."

Cloud let out a soft snuffle, as if agreeing, and lowered his head to nuzzle Poppy’s shoulder.

They rode in silence, a beautiful picture of a sad girl and a sorrowful pony. As the silence lingered and time ticked by, Poppy realized, for the first time in many hours, she felt a change. A little less anxiety, and a little more… hope. She squeezed Cloud gently with her legs, encouraging a small walk.

As they continued to ride, Mrs. Willowbrook led the lesson through various movements, each aimed at helping the children focus on the task in front of them. As Poppy watched, she felt a sense of warmth spread throughout her body. 

Mrs. Willowbrook began asking her to guide Cloud around the arena in different patterns. She encouraged her to think about where Cloud's ears should be and where his feet were headed. Slowly, carefully, Poppy began to concentrate on Cloud. It was work, sure, but in this work, the fears and anxieties she’d felt about her grandpa’s sickness receded for the first time.

Cloud was perfect. He followed Poppy’s instructions carefully, his movements precise and steady. With her heart as light as a feather, Poppy began to relax and trust him more and more.

After a while, Mrs. Willowbrook clapped her hands. "Okay, class! Time for a short rest."

The other children dismounted, chattering excitedly. But Poppy wanted to stay. The idea of returning to reality with her grandfather made her stomach flip.

"Cloud is very well-behaved," Poppy thought, and asked Mrs. Willowbrook if she could sit on Cloud and keep him for a few more moments. The instructor gladly agreed.

As Poppy sat upon Cloud, her hands resting peacefully on his mane, she watched the other children playing a game, their joyous sounds almost mocking her sadness. For a brief moment, Poppy wished she could escape into the safe confines of the Whispering Woods Riding School and forget all the things going on in the "real world".

Suddenly, Poppy's mum came to get her and, as they headed for the hospital, Poppy was unusually quiet, taking only a few seconds to say goodbye to Cloud before racing with her family to see her grandfather.
When they arrived at the hospital, her parents were unusually upset. Tears were rolling from her mother's eyes, and even her usually strong father was struggling to hold it together. 
Poppy, as she ran down the hospital halls, clutched her grandfather’s favourite peppermint candies, holding them tight in her hand. The scent of the candies filled her mind, which made her heart calm and feel strangely at ease. She found her way into the room, and with an awful silence, she knew what had happened before her own eyes saw it.

Grandpa's eyes were closed, and a peaceful smile had spread across his face. He lay still in the bed. The room was quiet, filled only with the hushed sounds of her parents and a few visiting aunts.

Poppy stood by her grandfather's bedside, feeling a mix of overwhelming sadness and, strangely, a calmness she hadn’t expected. The gentle ride with Cloud seemed to have somehow prepared her for this moment. She gently took her grandfather’s hand, her fingers interlacing with his. His skin was cool, but she still felt a connection, a sense of peace that transcended the sadness.

She spoke to him, whispering stories of her pony ride, about how gentle Cloud had been, and how they’d both seemed to understand each other's sorrows. She spoke of his happy memories of his favourite adventures through the magical woods and how Cloud would surely be by his side now. Poppy knew that whatever this new journey meant for Grandpa, he would be in peace.

That night, when it was time for bed, Poppy remembered the last thing she saw before leaving Cloud. She closed her eyes and whispered a story to the grey pony in her mind. Her last thought before falling asleep was, "Thank you, Cloud."

After that day, Poppy was sad, for she would miss the many special Tuesdays, for there would be no more grandfather, peppermints, or magical woods tales. The school became more difficult as well, but she never once abandoned her love for the stables or her ponies. She kept going to the school every Tuesday. When the time came to ride again, she made sure she requested the saddest and calmest ponies and, from that point onwards, she knew she had an especially close connection to horses. She remembered to tell her saddest stories while they galloped. 

Years later, Poppy became a riding instructor herself. She made sure that every child, particularly those facing difficult times, had the chance to ride the calmest ponies in her own arena and tell them their stories, just as she had done. She always told her students that, even when it felt like the world was against them, there was always a friendly horse ready to share their burden and allow them to find a moment of peace. She knew, with the unwavering certainty in her heart, that Cloud would have liked that.

And, when the sky seemed overcast, as it often did, Poppy remembered her grandfather's stories about magical horses with wings, a constant and gentle reminder of his everlasting love, which filled Poppy’s heart for all her Tuesdays. And the whispering woods still whispered on.
