<title>A Brave Knight's Quest to Rescue the Princess from the Dragon's Lair.</title><body>Sir Reginald the Rather Round, a knight whose armour glistened with more fingerprints than actual shine, adjusted his helmet. It promptly slipped over his eyes, plunging him into temporary darkness. "Blast!" he muttered, bumping into a rather large, and decidedly grumpy, sheep.

"Baa!" the sheep replied, sounding remarkably like a disgruntled landlord demanding rent.

Sir Reginald, once he'd wrestled his helmet back into a presentable position, sighed. This was hardly the heroic start he'd envisioned for his quest. He’d been tasked with rescuing Princess Petunia, known throughout the kingdom, not for her beauty (though she was quite lovely when her hair wasn't resembling a bird's nest), but for her remarkable ability to misplace things. Mainly, the kingdom’s supply of custard.

The dragon, a grumpy old thing called Grumbles, had, apparently, stolen her. Or, more accurately, she’d wandered off, probably in search of a particularly rare type of marshmallow, and ended up in Grumbles’ lair.

Sir Reginald took a deep breath, the scent of damp earth and faintly singed toast filling his nostrils. His trusty steed, a pony named Horace who was far more interested in eating clover than embarking on daring adventures, gave a particularly loud snort.

"Right, Horace," Reginald said, patting the pony's slightly muddy side, "to the Dragon's Lair! And try not to eat any more of my trousers." (Horace had a particular fondness for tweed.)

Their journey was, to put it mildly, eventful. They encountered a family of particularly peckish badgers who attempted to steal Horace's (very small) saddlebags, a grumpy gnome who demanded a toll of three riddles (Sir Reginald only managed to answer one, and even that was a lucky guess), and a river infested with singing, and quite frankly terrible, frogs.

"Ribbit, ribbit, the brave knight's a fright, ribbit, ribbit, he can't even write!" one particularly bold frog croaked.

Sir Reginald, deeply offended, tried to argue, but Horace, distracted by a particularly juicy patch of reeds, promptly pulled him off his feet and into the water. They emerged, dripping and covered in pondweed, just as the sun began to set.

Finally, after what felt like several lifetimes and a considerable amount of sneezing (the pondweed), they arrived at the Dragon's Lair. It looked less like you'd imagine a fearsome lair – dark, smoky, and filled with the bones of vanquished heroes – and more like a slightly untidy, oversized shed. The door was crookedly hanging open, revealing a glimpse of… well, mostly junk.

Sir Reginald, steeling his nerves (which promptly began to wobble), dismounted Horace and carefully edged towards the entrance. He drew his sword, which, to be fair, was more of a butter knife with a pointy edge. He’d polished it until it shone, but it lacked a certain… *sharpness*.

"Halt!" he shouted, his voice cracking slightly. "I, Sir Reginald the Rather Round, have come to rescue Princess Petunia!"

A voice, surprisingly high-pitched and whiny, echoed from within the lair. "Oh, is that you, Reginald? About time! Could you maybe close the door? It's a bit draughty."

Sir Reginald cautiously stepped inside. The air was filled with the smell of burnt toast and something vaguely resembling cheese. The "lair" was indeed cluttered. Piles of newspapers, empty biscuit tins, and a rather impressive collection of bottle caps littered the floor. In the middle of this chaos, sat a very large, very green, and surprisingly fluffy dragon, hunched over a jigsaw puzzle.

"Grumbles?" Sir Reginald asked, lowering his butter knife slightly.

The dragon sighed dramatically. "Yes, it's me. And before you ask, yes, I know I'm supposed to be a fearsome dragon. But frankly, guarding a princess is far more tedious than it's cracked up to be."

Princess Petunia, meanwhile, was sitting on a pile of cushions, happily eating a large sandwich. Her hair, as usual, resembled a bird's nest.

"Reginald!" she exclaimed, crumbs falling onto her dress. "You finally made it! I was starting to get bored. Grumbles here is hopeless at charades."

"And she keeps hiding the good marshmallows!" Grumbles grumbled, pointing a claw at a half-eaten packet of, indeed, rather exquisite marshmallows.

Sir Reginald, completely bewildered, sheathed his butter knife. "So… you… you haven't… harmed the Princess?"

Grumbles rolled his eyes. "Harmed? Honestly! She's been teaching me how to do crosswords! And she's quite good at telling jokes. Although her custard-related puns are a bit… well, cheesy."

Princess Petunia giggled. "He's got a terrible sense of humour, but he's quite good company, really."

"But… the custard?" Sir Reginald stammered. "The kingdom is in a custard crisis!"

Princess Petunia waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, that. I… may have misplaced it. Again. I thought the dragon might enjoy a custard cream or two. It would match his colour. Didn't you bring any?"

Sir Reginald felt his jaw drop. He, the bravest knight of the realm (or at least, he liked to think so), had battled badgers, gnomes, terribly singing frogs, and a pony with a penchant for tweed, all for nothing.

"Right," he said slowly, "So, essentially, I've come on a wild custard goose chase?"

"More or less," Grumbles confirmed, returning to his jigsaw puzzle. "Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'm almost finished. This corner piece is proving remarkably challenging."

Sir Reginald slumped onto a nearby pile of newspapers (a rather dog-eared edition about a missing cat). Horace ambled in, sniffing around for stray biscuits.

"Well," he said, after a prolonged silence, "I suppose I should report back to the King. Though I doubt he'll be pleased."

Princess Petunia looked thoughtful. "Perhaps you could tell him that the threat has been, well, diffused. And maybe suggest he sends a fresh supply of custard?"

Grumbles looked up, his eyes gleaming. "And perhaps a few more jigsaw puzzles? And maybe, just maybe, those marshmallow ones?"

Sir Reginald sighed. His quest hadn’t exactly gone as planned. But, looking at the slightly chaotic scene before him, he felt a strange sense of… relief. Perhaps rescuing princesses wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Besides, the lack of danger also meant the lack of armour-related injuries. He took the last bit of chocolate he had in his pocket and gave it to Horace, who ate it in three big bites.

The dragon's Lair, filled with newspapers, bottlecaps, and a rather round Knight, wasn't so terrible after all. As for the custard? Well, that was a problem for another day.

"Right, Horace," Sir Reginald said, getting to his feet. "Let's go home, and if you see the missing custard, tell me."

And so, Sir Reginald, the rather round knight, left the dragon's lair not with a rescued princess, but with a riddle, a missing custard, and a lot to think about at the same time he left a very confused dragon sorting the jigsaw puzzle.

As they rode back, Sir Reginald began to wonder if Grumbles will get his lost marshmallow and Princess Petunia would stop hiding all the custard. What adventures awaited the brave knight? Perhaps one involving a cake? Or maybe a cheese hunt?
