<title>Sharing Snacks with a New Friend</title><body>Once upon a time, in a sunny little town called Sunnyville, lived a young girl named Lily. Lily had bright, bouncy red hair, freckles that danced across her nose, and a smile that could light up the whole world. Every day, Lily would skip to the park, her favorite place in Sunnyville, with a small, red backpack swinging on her back.

In her backpack, Lily always carried the most important things: a colorful drawing pad, a box of crayons, a bottle of water, and most importantly, her snacks! Today's snacks were extra special. Her mommy had packed her a delicious assortment of goodies – crunchy apple slices, juicy orange segments, and a handful of her favorite, yummy star-shaped crackers.

Lily loved going to the park. It was filled with tall, whispering trees, green, grassy fields, and a sparkling blue pond where the ducks happily paddled. She loved to swing so high she felt like she could touch the clouds. She loved to slide down the big, twisty slide until her tummy tickled. But most of all, Lily loved to sit under the biggest oak tree in the park and draw.

As Lily skipped into the park, she noticed something different. Sitting on a bench, away from everyone else, was a little boy. He looked a little sad. He had messy brown hair, and his clothes were slightly rumpled. He clutched a worn-out teddy bear close to his chest. Lily, being a kind and curious girl, decided to go and say hello.

She walked towards him, her red backpack bouncing on her back. "Hello!" she said with a friendly smile.

The little boy looked up, startled. His eyes were big and brown, and a little shy. "H-hello," he mumbled.

"My name is Lily," she said, "What's your name?"

"I'm Tom," he replied, still looking a bit unsure.

"It's nice to meet you, Tom," said Lily. "Are you having fun at the park?"

Tom shook his head slowly. "Not really," he said, looking down at his teddy bear. "I… I don't know anyone here."

Lily’s heart went out to Tom. She understood how it felt to be new and not know anyone. “I can understand that” She said and quickly brightened up. "I'm new here too! I usually draw here. Would you like to draw with me?"

Tom looked up at her, his brown eyes widening slightly. He seemed a little surprised but also a little happy. "R-really?" he stammered.

"Of course!" Lily said with enthusiasm. "I love to draw! And, I brought snacks! Would you like some?" She pointed to her red backpack.

Tom's eyes widened again. He looked around and hesitantly nodded. “Yes please,"

Lily beamed. She sat down beside Tom on the bench, carefully taking out her drawing pad and crayons. She opened her backpack and spread out her snacks. "See! Apple slices, orange segments, and star crackers!" she said, showing them to him. "Which one do you want first?"

Tom looked at the snacks with wide eyes. He pointed towards an orange segment, and Lily giggled. "Good choice! Those are delicious!" she said, handing him a juicy slice.

Tom took the orange segment and tentatively took a bite. A small smile crept onto his face. "Mmm," he said. "This is really good."

Lily smiled too. "I told you! My mommy always packs the best snacks." She offered him an apple slice next.

They sat side by side, eating their snacks and starting to draw. Lily showed Tom how to draw a big, happy sun with smiling clouds. Tom showed Lily how to draw his teddy bear, Mr. Snuggles. They giggled as they scribbled, trying to make the pictures as funny as they could. The sharing of snacks was proving to be a brilliant conversation starter.

As they ate, Lily noticed that Tom seemed very careful with his snacks. He took small bites and offered his crackers. He didn't seem to have any snacks of his own.

“Do you want some star-shaped crackers, Tom?” she asked, opening the box.

Tom’s eyes lit up. “Are those…are they yours?” he questioned.

“Yes!” Lily said, picking them up. “I can eat as many as I want. There are more than enough. They're my favourites!" She handed him a handful.

Tom reached out to them tentatively, like they were precious jewels. “Thank you,” he said quietly.

“You’re welcome!” Lily replied happily, pleased to share.

After a while, they finished their snacks. Lily saw that Tom was still looking at her snack box.

“You know," Lily said suddenly. "I think I brought too many crackers, Tom. I can’t finish them all by myself. Would you like to keep the rest for later?”

Tom’s face flushed pink. He nodded his head. "Really? Wow! Thank you, Lily!" He seemed absolutely thrilled.

Lily smiled warmly. "You're welcome! It's more fun sharing, isn't it?" she said.

Tom beamed, truly for the first time. "It is," he agreed, "especially when the snacks are this good."

They spent the rest of the afternoon drawing, laughing, and getting to know each other. Lily learned that Tom loved playing with cars, his favorite colour was blue, and Mr. Snuggles had a tiny, patched-up ear. Tom learned that Lily loved singing silly songs, that she really liked the colour yellow, and that she loved to eat apples!

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in beautiful shades of orange and purple, it was time for Lily to go home.

“I had so much fun today, Tom," Lily said as she packed up her drawing things.

Tom looked at her with a wide, happy smile. He had never been so glad to find a friend before. "Me too, Lily!" he replied. "Thank you for sharing your snacks and your drawings with me."

"It was my pleasure!” Lily replied. “We should do this again tomorrow!”

"Yes, please!" Tom answered instantly.

Lily waved goodbye, and as she walked away from the park, she knew that she and Tom were going to be the best of friends. The empty feeling of loneliness Tom had experienced earlier had vanished, replaced by a warmth and the excitement of knowing he now had a friend.

As she walked home, she thought about how happy she felt. Sharing her snacks with Tom had made her feel incredibly good. She had made a new friend, and that was the best feeling in the world. She realised the snacks tasted even better when you shared them.

The next day, Lily and Tom met at the park again. Lily's mommy had packed her even more snacks. This time, there were little sandwiches, some grapes, and yes, even more star-shaped crackers. Tom had his drawing pad ready.

From that day on, Lily and Tom were the best of friends. They spent their afternoons together, drawing, playing, and sharing their snacks under the big oak tree in the park. And every time they shared a snack, it tasted even better than the last. They learnt many other valuable lessons and, as time passed, continued to explore the world of friendship together and learning that it always, always, is fun sharing! And that being kind always pays off. The most enjoyable snacks are those shared with a friend.
