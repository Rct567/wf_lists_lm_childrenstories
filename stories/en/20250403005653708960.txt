<title>Singing Lovely Songs with a Beautiful, Kind Robin</title>
<body>
“Wake up, Rosie! Wake up, Tommy! It’s a beautiful morning!” chirped a tiny voice, laced with the sweetest music.

Rosie, a girl with a cloud of curly brown hair and eyes like sparkling pools, yawned. "Mmmph… Five more minutes, Mum?"

Tommy, her younger brother, with a mop of sandy blonde hair and a gap-toothed grin, mumbled, "No more… monsters, Rosie… so sleepy…"

“Not Mum! Silly! It's me! Robin!” The voice, light as a feather, insisted.

Rosie sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Tommy followed suit, peering over the side of his bed. And there, perched on the windowsill, was the most magnificent bird they had ever seen. It wasn't just any bird; it was a robin. But this robin shimmered, its breast a vibrant, almost unbelievably bright red. It seemed to glow, and its voice…oh, its voice! It was the sweetest melody they had ever heard, full of happiness and joy.

“Robin?” Rosie whispered, awestruck.

“The very one!” the robin replied, bobbing its head. “And it’s time to sing! Come on, you two! Let’s sing with me!”

Tommy was suddenly wide awake. "Sing? With a robin? Really, really?"

“Absolutely!” the robin chirped. “Singing is the best thing to do on a sunny morning like this! What would you like to sing about?”

Rosie giggled. “I don’t know. What do robins sing about?”

Robin puffed out his chest. “We sing about everything! Sunshine, flowers, yummy worms, friendship, and of course, the joy of waking up with your favorite little people!”

Tommy bounced on his bed. "Yummy worms? Can we sing about worms?"

Robin tilted its head. "We certainly can! But first, tell me, what are you feeling today?"

Rosie considered this. “I feel happy… and a little hungry. And maybe… a tiny bit grumpy because I was dreaming of fluffy clouds.”

"Ah! The trifecta!" Robin exclaimed. "We can sing about all three! Let's start with happiness! Follow me!"

And with that, Robin launched into a song, a song so pure and beautiful that it filled the room. The words poured out in lilting, melodic phrases:

(Robin sings)
*“Sunrise paints the sky with gold,*
*A brand new story to unfold!*
*Little hearts are starting to beat,*
*Dancing happy on tiny feet!”*

Rosie and Tommy, initially shy, began to hum along, their voices joining Robin’s in a shaky chorus. By the end of the first verse, they were laughing.

“That’s amazing!” Rosie said, her grumpiness completely forgotten.

Tommy clapped his hands. "More! Sing more!"

“Excellent! Next, a song for the tummy!" Robin announced, "For the rumbling and grumbling! Prepare yourselves for… 'The Wormly Wurm Song!'”

(Robin sings)
*“Oh, the worm is wiggly, the worm is round,*
*Buried deep in the good, soft ground!*
*A tasty treat for a little beak,*
*Making hungry tummies speak!*”

Tommy doubled over with giggles. "Wormy wurm! That's silly!"

Rosie couldn’t help but smile. “It’s a good song, Robin. But I don’t think I’d like to eat a worm, even if I’m hungry.”

“Well, worms are a robin's favorite food,” Robin replied with a little chuckle. "But the song is more about the feeling of being hungry. Which song should we sing next?"

“The fluffy cloud song!” Rosie suggested, remembering her dream.

Robin winked. “Excellent choice! Here comes... 'Cloudy Dreams'! Get ready to feel light as air!”

(Robin sings)
*“White as cotton, soft and high,*
*Clouds drift gently in the sky.*
*Lazy breezes gently blow,*
*Watching worlds down, down below!*”

As Robin sang, Rosie closed her eyes, imagining herself floating amongst the clouds, feeling the gentle wind on her face.

"That's lovely," she whispered.

Tommy added, "So comfy…like my blanket."

Robin flitted closer, landing on the edge of Rosie's bed. "And that, my friends, is the power of a song! To lift your spirits, to share the joy, to make you happy. What else do you like to sing about? We could try a song about flowers!"

Rosie’s eyes widened. “Oh, yes! Flowers! My favourite is the sunflower.”

“Brilliant! Then we shall sing of sunflowers! And this is the song… 'Sunshine’s Sunflower Song'! Pay attention!”

(Robin sings)
*“Giant sunflowers, tall and bright,*
*Reaching upwards for the light.*
*Smiling faces, golden hues,*
*Drinking in the morning dews.*”

“Wonderful!” Tommy shouted. “What a sunny song.”

"And you’re doing wonderfully," Robin replied, praising their contributions. "Now tell me, what does a robin do when it’s not singing? Besides looking after its babies?"

Rosie thought hard. "Maybe... play?"

"Correct!" Robin affirmed. “Do you both enjoy playing?"

Rosie and Tommy nodded vigorously. "We do!"

“Excellent. How about a playing song? It will get you jumping, moving around, ready to face the day! This song is known as the... 'Playful Day Song'!"

(Robin sings)
*“Sunshine up and shining, the fun must now commence,*
*Let's play all the day together, with no fear or defence!*
*Build a fort of blankets or a castle strong and bold,*
*Every moment, something joyful, waiting to unfold.”*

The rhythm was catchy, and Rosie and Tommy began to bounce, clap, and skip around their room, their sleepy feelings completely gone.

Suddenly, a gentle knock came at the door. "Rosie? Tommy? Are you awake? Breakfast is ready!" It was Mum’s voice.

Rosie and Tommy exchanged excited glances.

Robin looked at them knowingly. “It seems your breakfast awaits! But before you go, how about one final song? A song about… friends and families!”

“Yes, please!” Rosie and Tommy chorused, already anticipating the music.

Robin took a deep breath and began:

(Robin sings)
*“A family's like a gentle hug,*
*A warm embrace, a friendly bug.*
*Sharing smiles and playing games,*
*Whispering softly, speaking names.*
*Friends by your side, as good as gold,*
*Stories that always will be told!”*

As Robin finished singing, Rosie and Tommy ran to the door, their hearts full of warmth and joy.

"Thank you, Robin!" Rosie said, grinning.

"Thank you for the lovely songs!" Tommy echoed, beaming.

Robin smiled back, its red breast practically glowing. “You are very welcome! Remember, the world is full of music, just waiting to be sung. Sing your own songs, little ones, and make the world a more beautiful place. See you tomorrow!" And with a final flutter of its wings, Robin flew away, disappearing as swiftly as it had appeared.

Rosie and Tommy ran to the kitchen, where the scent of pancakes and berries filled the air.

“Guess what, Mum?” Rosie said, her eyes sparkling. “We just sang with a robin!”

Mum smiled, setting a plate of pancakes in front of them. “A robin, you say? Well, that’s very nice. Now, let’s hear all about it. And then, how about singing a little song together, you two?"

And as they ate their breakfast, Rosie and Tommy did just that, their voices blending together, sharing the music and the joy of the morning, forever remembering the beautiful, kind robin and its singing lovely songs. They knew they had been visited by something special, and they eagerly looked forward to the next day and to more songs with their singing robin friend. The day was filled with playful, sung renditions of their own songs, sharing the songs learned with everyone they met. What a lovely day.
