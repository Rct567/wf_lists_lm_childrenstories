<title>Secrets the Wind Whispered in the Night</title>
<body>
Barnaby Buttercup, a boy with hair the colour of dandelion fluff and a nose that twitched like a startled rabbit, lived in a wonky, leaning cottage at the very edge of Bumblebrook village. Bumblebrook was a place of buzzing bees, giggling grubs, and exceptionally shy snails. Barnaby, however, was none of these things. He was boisterous, bursting with ideas, and possessed a truly remarkable ability to trip over absolutely nothing.

One Tuesday (or was it Wednesday? Time in Bumblebrook, as you might imagine, wasn't taken very seriously), Barnaby was tucked into his bed, a rather lumpy mattress made of straw and dreams. The curtains, which were actually old tea towels sewn together by his eccentric Aunt Agatha, billowed wildly. The wind, a mischievous fellow named Reginald, had arrived. Reginald, you see, had a particular fondness for Bumblebrook, and particularly, for whispering secrets.

That night, the wind howled and whistled. Reginald was in fine form, swirling through the branches of the ancient oak tree outside Barnaby's window and rattling the loose shingles on the cottage roof.

Barnaby, even though he was normally asleep by the time the sun dipped its toes in the Honeycombe River, was wide awake. He had, earlier that day, accidentally poured a whole jar of glitter into Mrs. Higgins' prize-winning prize-winning rhubarb crumble. It was still giving him a case of the giggles.

"Whoosh!" went the wind.

"Whisper...whistle...squawk..." added Reginald, the wind.

Barnaby sat up, his dandelion fluff of hair practically standing on end. "Did you… did you say something, Mr. Wind?" he squeaked.

The wind gusted playfully, ruffling Barnaby's hair. “Shhh,” Reginald seemed to be saying, and then in a slightly less noisy tone, whispered: "...Secrets...under…the…old…cheese…in…the…buttery…”

"Secrets?" Barnaby repeated, his eyes widening like saucers. Secrets were absolutely the most interesting things in the world, especially when whispered by the wind. He leaped out of bed, forgetting completely that he was wearing a particularly large pair of stripy pyjamas.

The buttery was a small, cool room attached to the kitchen, where they kept the butter, the milk, and, of course, the cheese. It was usually a very boring place. Barnaby couldn't imagine it containing anything even remotely secretive.

He tiptoed down the creaky wooden stairs, carefully avoiding the loose floorboard that squeaked like a grumpy dormouse. His bare feet pattered softly on the cold flagstones.

The buttery door creaked open, revealing a room illuminated only by the dim moonlight filtering through the small window. There, on a wooden shelf, sat a large wheel of cheddar cheese. It looked as though it had been there for an age.

Barnaby pulled a face. "Cheese," he muttered. "Very interesting." He poked it cautiously. "Nothing special."

Then he remembered the wind's instruction – "under." He looked under the cheese. Nothing. He lifted the cheese. Even less nothing.

Suddenly, he heard a giggle. A tiny, high-pitched giggle, coming from under the cheese.

Barnaby, even though a little scared, was a brave boy (except, of course, when faced with spiders, which were his arch-enemies). He peered closely. He leaned down, pushing aside the aged cheddar. And there, nestled beneath the cheese, was a tiny, almost invisible door. It was no bigger than his thumb.

"Good heavens," he whispered, his voice a mixture of excitement and bewilderment. He pushed the tiny door. It opened with a delicate click, revealing… darkness.

Taking a deep breath, and forgetting all about the stripy pyjamas, Barnaby plunged a finger into the darkness.

He felt something. A tiny, furry… thing!

He wiggled his finger. The furry thing wiggled back.

“Hello?” Barnaby whispered.

A squeaky voice responded, “Is… is that you? The one with the fluffy hair?”

Barnaby felt a thrill of anticipation. He was never disappointed, even when his most wonderful moments of the day, when making up a great idea, led him right into a hole or down into some water, or he did, as a young boy, run into a large tree; or, and the last of all and possibly the greatest of these great moments, when he gave his very first, not exactly on point but entirely full of heart, first kiss to the young miss Willow by the lake; all he knew was, life was all it was cracked up to be.

"I am, yes! Who are you?"

"I'm… Penelope!" The squeaky voice sounded quite proud. "Penelope Picklebottom."

Barnaby was already enjoying this enormously. “And where am I?”

"You are in… the Secret Cheese Society of Bumblebrook, of course!”

"The Secret Cheese Society?" Barnaby repeated, mystified. He peered closer and could barely see now.

Penelope's voice was now much clearer, from the tiny door: “We gather under the cheese every Tuesday. We have cheese crackers. And stories. But we can't find the… the secret cheese squeaker."

Barnaby was utterly confused, but totally thrilled. “Secret cheese squeaker?!”

“Yes,” Penelope squeaked. “It's very important to us. Without it, we can't… sing the cheese anthem properly.”

The cheese anthem? Barnaby decided that he absolutely HAD to know about this. He squeezed himself through the tiny door. It wasn't easy. His stripy pyjamas got a bit stuck.

On the other side, he found himself in a miniature ballroom, constructed, surprisingly, out of rind. There were small, cheese-shaped chairs, tiny tables laden with miniature cheese crackers, and… a very concerned-looking group of field mice. They were dressed in tiny waistcoats and bow ties.

Penelope Picklebottom, Barnaby noticed, was an unusually portly mouse, with spectacles perched on her tiny nose.

“Welcome, welcome!” she squeaked. “We’ve been expecting you. We’ve had a whisper, from… the wind.”

Barnaby, blushing a bit with pride, smiled and then asked, “So, this ‘Secret Cheese Squeaker’…”

Penelope sighed dramatically. “Yes. It was the thing that made the cheese squeak just at the right time to mark the special moments of our gatherings, the things the cheese mice sang of for all time. For years and years we all did very well with this device. Then… poof! It has gone!”

Barnaby, intrigued, helped Penelope and the others.

After some investigation, led by a team-up of a mouse called Montague who was great at logic and one, very small mouse called Prudence who loved riddles, they uncovered the fact that the secret squeaker wasn’t a gadget at all. It was, in fact, a very special kind of tiny, squeaky beetle who squeaked on demand, when it heard certain sounds.

But where had it gone?

The clues led them on a merry chase. They followed the trail of tiny cheese crumbs (apparently the beetle had a sweet tooth). They questioned a grumpy old badger, who claimed to know nothing (but had cheese crumbs all over his waistcoat, which was rather telling). They deciphered riddles, found a set of special sounds, and listened and listened until at long last, the squeaker beetle was discovered, hidden in a very peculiar place.

It turned out that, during Barnaby’s glitter incident, the secret cheese squeaker, who was allergic to glitter, had fled into the garden. It had gone and hidden itself beneath Mrs. Higgins' award-winning rhubarb patch!

Barnaby was immensely pleased with himself. Mrs. Higgins, however, was less thrilled to see her rhubarb uprooted (although she *was* very excited by the squeaker beetle, and was, on reflection, immensely kind).

But the greatest discovery of the evening, after much effort to put things right, came as a full room celebration: when everyone did find themselves seated, it turned out that the cheese squeaker hadn’t squeaked *at all.* All those nights, singing along, trying again, singing along.

But after a few hours of this wonderful mess, and then it was, when it was finally ready.
Then, to the surprise of all in the hall, someone, yes – one small, unassuming field mouse – burst into a huge, beautiful song. Not a sound was left by anyone but him: the melody began to make the wheels turn as if by some kind of music magic! The walls of the room started glowing, even in that darkness!

And Barnaby's heart soared as the song filled the miniature ballroom. He now saw his own future:

He’d discovered a secret society. He'd met talking mice. He had solved a mystery. And he’d made new friends!

After much cheering from everyone, he left with his newly made friends. Penelope gave him a hug, and a small box of miniature cheese crackers to take home with him.

"Don't forget to listen to the wind, Barnaby," Penelope squeaked. "It knows all the secrets."

Back in his own bed, exhausted but exhilarated, Barnaby closed his eyes.

The wind rustled the curtains, whispering a new secret.

“Pshhhhh...more... adventures... tomorrow…"
Barnaby smiled, already dreaming of the possibilities. He could hardly wait. He knew he would hear from the wind in the night. And whatever whispered in the night, it would be the most amazing thing, whatever it was. Barnaby Buttercup, adventurer extraordinaire, was ready for anything, especially if it involved cheese, secrets, and maybe just a few more scrapes with glitter. He drifted off to sleep, the smell of cheddar and adventure filling his dreams. He knew one thing for sure: life in Bumblebrook was anything but boring, especially when you had a friend like the wind. And who knows, perhaps he would even discover where all that cheese came from one day? The next secret whispered by the wind, perhaps...
