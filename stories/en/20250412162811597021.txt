<title>Harold Horse's Hasty Run to See His Family First.</title>
<body>
Harold Horse was a horse of habits. Every Tuesday, he would wake up, stretch his long legs, and eat a pile of clover. Then, he'd trot around his paddock, admiring the daisies and chasing the butterflies. After that, it was a quick nap under the big oak tree. But today, Tuesday was different. Today was the day Harold was finally, finally going to visit his family!

He'd been living on Farmer Giles' farm for as long as he could remember. He loved Farmer Giles – the kind man always made sure Harold had fresh water and the tastiest hay. He had friends too: Bella the Beagle, who was always eager for a game of fetch, and Kevin the Cow, who loved to gossip about the weather. However, Harold missed his family. They lived far away, in the Whispering Woods, and he hadn't seen them in a very long time.

He'd received a letter (well, it was a drawing, really, sent by a friendly robin who remembered Harold's family), detailing how much his younger sister, Hazel, was growing and how his mother, Henrietta, was the healthiest she'd been in years. The drawing had been signed by his father, Horace, with a very impressive hoofprint. Harold’s heart swelled with happiness and he was now beside himself to see them!

He leaped out of his stable before he even had a chance to eat his usual pile of clover. "I'm going to see my family!" he whinnied to the sleeping sheep. He was so excited that he accidentally bumped into Bella, sending her tumbling into a pile of straw.

"Harold! Woah! Careful!" barked Bella, scrambling to her paws. "What's with the speedy start this morning?"

"I'm going to visit my family! In the Whispering Woods! Today!" Harold exclaimed, barely able to stand still.

Bella’s tail started wagging. “The Whispering Woods? That’s a long way. Need any help?"

"Oh, would you! That would be wonderful! I have to go right away though."

"Of course! Kevin! Are you awake?" Bella yelped in her excited tone.

Kevin, startled, woke with a start. “Moo? What in the… Oh, it's just you two. What’s all the commotion?” Kevin slowly began to get himself together.

"Harold is off to visit his family, in the Whispering Woods." Bella explained, bouncing on the ground. "We can help get him on the way, can’t we Kevin? The quickest route is through Farmer McGregor's cornfield, then across Willow Creek and through Bramble Bush Valley.

“Sounds…challenging." Kevin groaned.

"We must hurry then," Harold urged. "Every moment I spend here is a moment less with my family! "

Kevin and Bella both readily agreed that the first leg of Harold’s journey could easily be shortened if they went directly through the dreaded, yet convenient, Farmer McGregor’s cornfield.

They decided upon their plan of action quickly. Harold took the lead, Bella scouted out the best path, and Kevin offered his considerable size to guide them should they stray from the best route. The whole way they worked in excellent harmony!

As they approached the cornfield, Harold noticed Farmer McGregor watching them from his porch, wearing a stern expression.

"Uh oh," whined Bella, dropping low to the ground.

"Don't worry," Harold said with forced confidence. “Let’s just be quick.”

Harold, Bella, and Kevin burst into the cornfield. The tall corn stalks brushed against Harold's legs as he dashed through, Bella expertly navigated the twisting paths, and Kevin's broad frame provided a shield against the farmer's potential view. Despite the urgency, they made it out on the other side in good time.

They could hear Farmer McGregor shouting after them, but they were already far away, too busy dodging and leaping over discarded farm tools on the journey to the next leg.

They had to cross Willow Creek, a fast-flowing stream. It was too wide to jump, and there was no obvious bridge. Harold was worried.

"Don't worry," Bella barked. "Kevin, can you help?"

Kevin, with his strong physique, waded into the creek. The water barely reached his knees.

"Get on my back," he grunted. "One by one."

Harold, and then Bella, climbed onto Kevin's broad back, and Kevin slowly and carefully carried them across the rushing water. The current swirled and tugged, but Kevin held steady, his big brown eyes focused on the other side. They eventually all splashed down on the bank, grateful and relieved.

"Thank you, Kevin!" Harold said gratefully, shaking the water from his mane. "You're the best!"

"Anytime, Harold. Now, onward to Bramble Bush Valley!" Kevin retorted with a sigh.

Bramble Bush Valley was the next challenge. The path wound through a thick, thorny thicket. Harold was starting to tire.

"This is the tricky part," warned Bella. "Lots of prickly bushes and hidden holes. Harold, try to follow exactly where I go! We do not want to get lost.”

They advanced carefully, Bella leading the way. Harold, feeling tired but determined, tried his best to follow, dodging the prickly bushes as instructed, one by one. Every now and then, he could hear Kevin rumbling along behind them. Kevin had an incredibly loud sneeze now and then. He had to pause to do it. Luckily, Kevin's pauses were very short, so it didn’t take away much from the journey!

It took what felt like an eternity to cross through the thorny territory. The path got more winding and difficult. Eventually, they reached the other side, their legs scratched and slightly bleeding, but also filled with relief.

“We made it!" exclaimed Harold, panting.

"Whew," Kevin moaned. "I’m not sure my knees can handle much more.”

“Just a bit more now,” said Bella encouragingly, "The Whispering Woods is not too far ahead, based on my expertise."

They continued for a while longer, walking beside a gently babbling stream.

Soon, Harold saw it, on the horizon; a magical shimmer among the trees. It really did seem to be whispering to him, too. He galloped with a surge of fresh energy. He was almost there!

Finally, after what felt like an endless journey, they reached the edge of the Whispering Woods. The trees stood tall and silent, the leaves rustling in the wind. The air smelled fresh and filled with the scent of pine and earth.

"This is it, Harold," said Bella, nudging him with her nose. "We have to leave you here. We can't go in."

"Good luck!" Kevin added with a smile.

Harold, overcome with gratitude, nuzzled them both, nuzzling them. “Thank you, both! I couldn’t have done it without you. You are the best friends a horse could ever ask for!" Harold galloped to the centre of the Whispering Woods as fast as he could.

He quickly called out his family.

"Mother! Father! Hazel! Are you there?" he neighed with excitement.

A moment later, his mother, Henrietta, emerged from a cluster of trees. She was a beautiful mare with a kind face and a gentle gaze. Her coat shimmered in the sunlight.

"Harold! My darling Harold!" she whinnied, her eyes wide with happiness. She raced to Harold's side, rubbing her face against his.

Then, his father, Horace, a magnificent stallion with a strong, regal stance, came into view. He gave a hearty neigh of greeting, too, a truly loud whinny, and he hurried to embrace his son.

“My boy!” Horace boomed. "You've grown so big!”

Last of all, Hazel, his younger sister, who was now a small, graceful pony with a curious spark in her eyes, dashed out. She’d never met her older brother before and her face showed some genuine surprise!

“Harold! Is this really you?” she asked excitedly, hopping around.

Harold was surrounded by his family, bathed in love and affection. He laughed, he played, he listened to their stories, and told them all about Farmer Giles, Bella, and Kevin. He told them about his journey to the Whispering Woods, and his daring run through the cornfield. He told them every little detail of his life back on the farm, and enjoyed every moment. He ate a very pleasant lunch!

As the sun began to set, Harold knew it was time to leave. It had been an absolutely beautiful visit! It had made him very happy!

“I have to go back now, but I’ll come back soon,” he promised, giving Hazel one last nudge and snuggling into his parents' warm hugs.

“We’ll miss you,” Henrietta said softly.

"But we'll always be connected," declared Horace.

Harold galloped back towards the edge of the woods. He looked back once more. His family, now mere silhouettes against the golden sky, waved their hoofs at him and watched him return to the path.

As he trotted back across the fields, he felt a deep warmth in his heart. The run had been exhausting, and he had scratched knees to prove it, but it had also been worth it. Seeing his family, sharing laughter, and creating memories, had been everything he had hoped for.

He got back to Farmer Giles' farm after nightfall. He was exhausted. As soon as he had the opportunity to get to his stable, he collapsed right onto the hay. Farmer Giles found him asleep there the next morning. Farmer Giles brought him a gigantic pile of clover as a welcome back treat. Harold didn’t mind. Harold was content. He closed his eyes, dreaming of the Whispering Woods and of the day he’d run again to be with his beloved family.
