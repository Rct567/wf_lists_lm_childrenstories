<title>The Peacock Who Shared Colors With all of the Birds.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a valley where the sun always shone, lived a peacock named Percy. Now, Percy wasn't just any peacock. He possessed the most magnificent plumage the world had ever seen! His feathers shimmered with a thousand dazzling hues: emerald greens, sapphire blues, ruby reds, and golden yellows, all blended in an explosion of beauty.

One sunny morning, as Percy was preening himself, admiring his reflection in a clear pond, he heard a tiny, worried chirp.

"Excuse me," peeped a little wren, hopping nervously on a nearby branch. "Are you... are you Percy?"

Percy, startled, puffed out his chest. "Why, yes, I am. And who might you be, little one?"

"I'm Willow," the wren chirped, her tiny feathers a drab brown. "I... I was hoping you might help."

Percy, used to adulation and compliments, was taken aback. "Help? How can *I* possibly help a wren?"

"Well," Willow squeaked, "the Flutterby Festival is coming up. It's a grand celebration, a dance of all the birds in the valley. But… I feel so plain. All the other birds have such vibrant colors, and I'm just… brown." She hung her tiny head.

Percy chuckled. "Brown isn't so bad, little Willow. It's a good camouflage."

"But I want to dance and feel beautiful!" Willow burst out, her voice trembling.

Percy considered this. He had always enjoyed his own splendor, taking pride in his magnificent colors. But looking at Willow's dejection, a new thought began to form in his feathery head. He dipped his head in thought.

“Hmm…” Percy hummed thoughtfully, swirling around and around as he mulled the problem.

Just then, a bright red cardinal swooped down and perched on a branch nearby. “What’s all the fuss about?” he chirped, preening his perfectly crimson feathers.

Willow hid behind a nearby leafy branch, the slight breeze blowing through her modest feathers. Percy eyed the cardinal with mild displeasure. “Willow here is sad,” he began.

The cardinal cackled. “Sad? Why? Everyone is a perfectly bright color, what with our lovely festival next week.” He flitted a bit about.

Percy paused, considering how to answer. He cleared his throat, trying to maintain his air of authority.

“She feels a little, well, plain.”

The cardinal scoffed. “Plain? Ridiculous! Who needs to feel bad at all, what with such amazing colors everywhere!”

Percy bristled a little at the cardinal's condescending tone. He understood Willow's plight more than he thought. The other birds' colours seemed so bright in contrast with the shy wren's drab exterior.

Percy then made a sudden decision. "Willow," he said with surprising sincerity, "I think I can help." He lowered his proud peacock's head to her. "The thing is...I don’t really want to keep *all* the colours. I have so many, maybe...maybe some of them would look lovely on you?"

Willow gasped. “Really? But how... how could you do that?”

Percy chuckled again, his voice softer this time. "Well, you see these feathers? They’re magical. During the Flutterby Festival, a special dust floats through the valley. All birds will receive one colour from any other bird.”

“Wait! Is it safe?” Willow squeaked, looking up at Percy in anticipation.

“Of course it is!” Percy chirped, puffing out his chest again, “It’s the most wonderful dust. But only one bird can share. Every other bird can receive. Only the one sharing needs to give one of their colours.”

Willow thought for a moment. “Why are you doing this, Percy?”

Percy smiled, a genuine, kind smile that reached his eyes. "Because," he said softly, "everyone deserves to feel beautiful." He spread his magnificent tail feathers, showing off the breathtaking kaleidoscope of colours. "Look at them! Too much for one bird, really."

“Wow…” the little wren gasped.

“The dust should be available next week, before the festivities! Now, listen. There’s not much time. But how will you go with the dust? Who is ready?” Percy quizzed.

Willow chirped again. “Well, there’s the Flutterby festival!”

Percy knew he couldn’t share them all; that would be too much! He could only let Willow have one, if she wanted it.

“If you’d like one feather... from my colours, it will give you a hue for the day of the festival.” Percy said. “Maybe the same time tomorrow?”

Willow, excited, hopped with anticipation, chirping enthusiastically. “Oh, yes! Yes please, Percy!”

Percy winked, enjoying her enthusiasm. "Excellent! The dust will do all the work, my little friend."

The next morning, the red cardinal swooped down again, curious to find out the results. Willow was chirping as usual on her leafy branch, but there was an even higher pitched buzz to her voice than usual.

“What is it? Are you okay, little wren?” the cardinal hooted with mirth.

Percy walked over in silence and gave the cardinal a dismissive stare.

Percy spoke. “Indeed I am!” He stood, looking proud as usual. “So tell me. Do you know where the Flutterby Festival will be?”

“Yes,” Willow responded. “I will go.”

Percy preened one last time. The day was perfect, but what he didn’t realise was that one of his many colors would need to be offered to the other birds in order for them all to see their colours.

He then thought of how the fluttering would occur; all the butterflies. Fluttering and swirling.

He took the opportunity to show off some more. The sun was hitting the valley, just in time.

"Willow," he said gently, "Do you see the dust yet?"

Willow was indeed confused, with only a few moments remaining before the Flutterby festival!

"I see..." she began, hesitatingly. "Nothing."

Percy watched anxiously. He knew his part, and how it would work. But still, he hoped Willow would see!

“You have to feel it,” Percy explained gently.

“Feel… what, exactly?” Willow peeped back.

Percy was still preparing. The colours danced in his eyes and through his feathers as a golden light filled the valley. His gaze wandered all over, making him even more cautious of who to gift it to. He looked at the other birds; it was not hard to offer the other colours. However, to share, you really had to have some courage.

"Now!" he exclaimed.

And then... poof! A light burst, and the special dust surrounded him. The breeze lifted it towards the birds, turning them all in anticipation.

Willow gasped. A tiny shimmering speck of gold swirled near her, settling on her brow, tinting her otherwise dull feathers. At the exact same time, several red-colored feathers fell out of Percy's plumage!

The transformation! Each bird received one feather.

“Wow!” the birds screamed. The birds were finally ready, with one shared colour apiece!

Willow’s wings suddenly shone with a tiny glint of shimmering gold! She looked radiant.

And so, with the dust's help, other birds, including the cardinal, discovered the joy of wearing some of Percy’s radiant colours. The festival turned into a glorious spectacle, with birds of all kinds, their feathers now speckled with vibrant hues, danced under the sun.

Percy watched, beaming. He felt a warmth inside him he had never experienced before – a warmth more beautiful than any of his own feathers. He was proud, even though his feathers became slightly less dazzling; his joy in their happiness surpassed his initial vanity. The entire valley had become richer, filled with the vibrant colours of the Flutterby Festival, a festival built on kindness and the sharing of beauty.

And from that day forward, Percy continued to share his colours, never hesitating to sacrifice a little of his own splendour to bring joy and beauty to others. For he had learned that the true measure of beauty lies not in the colours you possess, but in the colours you share.
And the wren danced all the way through.

The End.
