<title>When Oliver Ostrich Outwitted Everyone and Overcame Obstacles Overly</title><body>
Oliver Ostrich wasn't like the other ostriches. Oh, he could run fast, that he could. He could outrun the cheetahs, the lions, and even the speedy gazelles! But Oliver also loved to think. While the other ostriches were busy pecking for tasty grubs or fluffing their feathers, Oliver was pondering problems. He was always asking "why?" and "how?" much to the amusement, and sometimes the annoyance, of his family.

His favourite pastime was observing. He would sit perfectly still, sometimes for hours, watching the weaver birds build their intricate nests, or the sun paint the sky with colours during the sunsets. He observed the changes in the weather, the patterns of the clouds, and the behaviour of every creature in the savanna.

Oliver’s family, the Ostrich family, were simple folk. They valued a good run, a full belly, and a safe place to sleep. They didn’t understand Oliver’s “thinking.”

"Oliver," his mother would often say, her voice gentle but firm, "Why are you always staring at the sky? Come and eat your bugs!"

"But Mother," Oliver would reply, "Why are the clouds shaped like fluffy sheep today and like dragons tomorrow?"

His siblings would snort with laughter. "Silly Oliver," they'd chirp. "Clouds are just clouds! Come on, let's race!"

One day, a particularly nasty drought settled over the savanna. The water holes began to dry up, and the sun beat down relentlessly. The once vibrant green grass turned brown and brittle. The animals grew thin and desperate.

The other ostriches grumbled. They complained about the heat and the lack of food. They ran around in circles, panicked and frustrated. Their only thought was to find water.

Oliver, however, used his observations. He remembered seeing, a few weeks before the drought, a small group of elephants digging near the edge of the savanna. He remembered where they had dug and how the ground looked different there.

He told his family about it. "I think," he said, his voice calm and steady, "that we should go where the elephants were digging. I saw the ground there. It might be soft and may contain a secret water source."

His family just looked at him.

“Oliver,” his father sighed, “that was weeks ago. You're remembering again! Running around, complaining, thinking – there's no time! We must find water, NOW!”

His siblings just nudged each other and giggled.

Oliver knew he had to do something. The other ostriches were too panicked to listen, so he decided he would act alone. He knew he was slower than them when he was not running, but he was far more patient and observant.

"I'm going to look," he declared, his voice full of resolve. And he began his trek, which the other ostriches thought was a fool’s errand.

He set off, walking away from the frenzied, fast-moving group. He trotted in the direction he remembered, towards the far side of the savanna where the elephants had been digging. He moved slowly but surely, never faltering, always looking, always thinking.

The journey was tough. The sun was scorching. The ground was cracked and dry. The journey seemed to take ages, each step made with careful intent. His beak felt dry, his legs grew weary, but his curiosity and determination spurred him forward.

He recalled the way the ground looked: loose and crumbly. He remembered seeing ants carrying tiny grains of soil, indicating, he thought, moisture below.

After what felt like a lifetime, he arrived at the spot. It was even drier than he expected, and it looked desolate, with a vast expanse of cracked, parched earth. Oliver nearly gave up. Then, remembering what he'd observed, he began to dig. He used his powerful claws and his strong beak, determined to push away the soil, which was easier in his location than other places on the savanna, since that's where the elephants had been.

He dug and dug, slowly at first, then more vigorously. He threw the dry earth to the side, pausing only to rest his weary limbs. The ground began to change, becoming a slightly different colour in a specific location.

After hours of digging, Oliver struck something hard. It was a rock. He pushed at it with his beak and clawed at it until it moved. He could see further now. Underneath the rock, the soil was darker and damp. It was cooler, too.

He dug faster, fuelled by the renewed hope that filled him. Finally, his beak hit something soft and yielding. He widened the hole and dipped his beak.

He gasped! It wasn’t much, but he could taste the cool, refreshing water. A trickle, no more, was seeping from the damp earth. Oliver had found water!

Exhausted but triumphant, Oliver rested briefly. He drank his fill of the tiny trickle, quenching his unbearable thirst, and felt a wave of utter joy surge through him. He knew the trickle might not be much, but it would be enough.

He raced back towards his family, as quickly as his weary legs would allow. He saw them milling about, desperate, arguing, almost hopeless, searching in all the wrong places.

"I found water!" he shouted, his voice hoarse from the lack of liquid and overuse. "I found water!"

His family just stared.

"Oliver, have you lost your mind?” said his sister. "There is no water!"

“You always daydream!” mocked his brother. “We need water, NOW!”

But Oliver persisted. He told them where he’d dug, exactly how they could find it. He urged them to believe in his observation. They laughed at him initially, but they saw the determination and the glint of hope in his tired, dusty eyes.

Slowly, hesitantly, his family started to listen. Seeing the determination in Oliver’s usually questioning eyes, his father nodded. “We should try.”

The Ostrich family followed Oliver back to the spot where he had been digging. They looked at the meager trickle of water, and their hearts sank. They looked at Oliver.

"It's not much," Oliver said, his voice filled with humility, "but it's something. It's a start."

They started digging in the areas around where he had dug. Slowly, as the sun dipped, other family members started finding little bits of water. Oliver, watching with them, observed that, near the roots of some stunted bushes, there was a tiny concentration of water.

They began to dig wider and deeper, and before long, the trickle grew into a small puddle. The other animals in the savanna, watching the frantic behaviour of the ostrisches, followed them, driven by desperation.

One by one, they started digging around the location. They found several of their own water sources, which had been there all the time, but hidden by the dry conditions. Soon, the puddle became a small, muddy pool. Other, smaller pools sprouted around it.

Soon, the water attracted others from all over the savanna, drawn by the glimmer of hope in their thirst. The tiny hole Oliver had made had become a symbol of resilience and hope, a testament to observation and critical thinking.

The lions and the gazelles, the elephants and the giraffes, all gathered there. They cautiously drank from the shared water, and a rare truce fell over the savanna.

Oliver watched the scene, a smile spreading across his beak. The water hole was small, and wouldn’t last forever. But the simple puddle had saved everyone. He hadn't just outwitted his family and the drought, but he had also shown that there could be co-operation across the groups, even under extreme pressure.

From that day on, things were different. The other ostriches, and all the other animals, treated Oliver with a new respect. His family were especially proud. His siblings, who had previously mocked him, started asking him questions.

Oliver was no longer just the “silly” ostrich. He was Oliver, the thinker, the observer, the one who outwitted the drought.

He continued to think and to observe. He learned more about the animals, the plants, the sky, and the land. He realized he could use his skills to help everyone. He also realized that sometimes, even the most observant people make mistakes.

He would lead the way to fresh grazing lands and, more importantly, would show other animals that, if they could work together, they could make difficult circumstances better. They did.

He began sharing his knowledge, explaining his observations, and teaching others to look closely. He showed the importance of thinking before acting, even in a crisis.

His family and the rest of the inhabitants of the savanna followed him whenever they ran into any obstacles. And he would almost always figure out how to handle the issue. He didn't always know what the best path was, but he certainly provided a better option for everyone around him.

The drought eventually passed. The rains returned, the grass grew tall, and the waterholes filled. But Oliver never stopped thinking. He never stopped observing. He never stopped learning. And he never forgot the lessons of the drought, that persistence and smartness could outpace the worst of events.

Oliver became known for his unwavering approach to difficulties: not just solving the problems, but understanding the fundamental factors involved, for he was, after all, an extremely logical ostrich. He became the go-to ostrich in any situation, from finding a lost chick to predicting a rainstorm. The other animals looked up to him. He helped save their entire savanna with his hard work, his patience, and his amazing brain. And all along, the ostrich never even came across any situations he could not overcome! The other animals knew him by a different name, as the young ostrich always overcame obstacles overly, or "Oliver, the Overcomer".
