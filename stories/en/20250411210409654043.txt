<title>Finding True Happiness By Helping Other People Right Now.</title><body>
“Pip! Wake up, sleepyhead!” A chirpy voice bounced off the walls of a tiny, mushroom-shaped house.

“Ugh, five more minutes, Daisy,” mumbled a voice from beneath a patchwork quilt.

“No can do, Pip! Today’s the day! Remember? We’re going to find the Happiness Gems!”

Pip groaned and slowly peeled back the quilt, revealing a small, furry creature with large, curious eyes and floppy ears. He yawned a huge, yawning yawn. "Happiness Gems? That sounds... like a lot of effort, Daisy."

Daisy, a bright-eyed little squirrel with a fluffy tail, puffed out her cheeks. "Effort? Nonsense! Finding the Happiness Gems is the most important quest we’ll ever undertake! They’re supposed to bring incredible joy!" She bounced excitedly on her tiny toes.

"Joy... sounds like I’d rather be back in bed," Pip grumbled, scratching behind one of his big ears.

Daisy sighed. “You’re such a grump, Pip. But the Happiness Gems aren't just *any* gems. They say each one represents a different way to be truly happy. And we *really* need some happiness. Remember how grumpy Mr. Grumbles is getting? And the butterflies are sad because they can’t find their favourite flower? Even the river is murmuring with discontent!”

Pip’s ears perked up slightly. He knew the forest was a little... out of sorts lately. Even he could feel the sadness hanging in the air. "Okay, okay, you’ve convinced me. But what’s the plan?"

"Well," Daisy chirped, pulling a brightly illustrated map from her tiny satchel, "the map leads us to three different locations, where we’re meant to find the Happiness Gems! The first location is near Old Man Willow's pond. It's where kindness lives! Let’s go!”

And so, the unlikely pair set off on their adventure. They trudged through the dewy grass, their footsteps light in the early morning air.

When they arrived at the pond, they found Old Man Willow, a wise old tree with long, flowing branches and a drooping face. He was surrounded by several crying water lilies.

"Oh dear," Daisy whispered. "What's wrong, Old Man Willow?"

Old Man Willow sighed, his leaves rustling sadly. "The lilies... they can't grow their best flowers. They need sun and help!"

Pip, usually hesitant, shuffled forward. "Help? How can we help?"

"There's a large boulder blocking the sunshine," explained Old Man Willow, "and these lily pads are getting no warmth or light because of it."

Daisy's eyes lit up. "We could move the boulder! Come on, Pip, let's get lifting!"

Pip stared at the enormous boulder. It looked impossibly heavy. "But…we're small! How can we possibly move that?"

Daisy put her hands on her hips. "We might be small, but we can be determined! We'll have to be brave!"

Pip took a deep breath. "Okay, okay, you're right. Let's give it a try."

Together, Daisy and Pip pushed and strained against the boulder. It didn't budge. They huffed and puffed, their faces red.

“It’s no use,” Pip huffed, sinking to the ground in defeat. “We’re not strong enough.”

Daisy, refusing to give up, paced back and forth. "Think, think... how can we move this?" She noticed something glinting in the sunlight. "Wait a moment!" She called.

She ran toward the forest's edge and, finding several sticks and a strong vine, grabbed a small, slender stick. She turned back to Pip and explained: "Use these levers!" She demonstrated by inserting the stick under the edge of the rock, then pushed down on it with the larger stick and the vine!

Pip stared at his small friend with amazement. They then worked on all the sides, pushing sticks and vines under the rock and turning it. After a time, inch by inch, and push by push, the boulder slowly began to shift!

Finally, with a final, mighty heave, the boulder rolled away, and the sunshine flooded the pond! The water lilies sighed with relief.

As the sun’s rays hit the pond, the water lilies, as though in gratitude, shimmered and bloomed in dazzling colors. A tiny, glittering gem emerged from the heart of one of the flowers.

“Wow!” Pip gasped, his eyes wide with awe.

Daisy picked up the gem. It sparkled with a warm, golden light. "The first Happiness Gem! It looks like it's a gem of 'kindness'," she said. “Old Man Willow, you're kind of helping people!”

“Thank you for the help, little ones,” Old Man Willow said, his branches rustling with joy. "This warms my heart!”

Pip felt a strange feeling bubbling up inside him – a warm, happy feeling he'd never experienced before. It was… nice. Really nice! "This is… kind of great, isn't it?" he mumbled, beaming, and he found it much easier to open the world for a brighter place for him.

They moved on to the second location, which the map declared was at the base of the Whispering Waterfall, and that location was the 'gift of helpfulness'! They found a frantic group of beavers frantically working away. They appeared panicked!

"What's wrong, Mr. and Mrs. Beaver?" asked Daisy.

"The dam!" squeaked Mr. Beaver, his voice trembling. "It's broken! The river is overflowing, and our lodge is flooded!"

Pip’s stomach sunk. Water. Again!

“We need more trees to rebuild it,” Mrs. Beaver wailed. “But it is difficult!”

Pip, despite his usual reluctance, felt a sudden urge to act. "How can we help?" he asked, surprising even himself.

“We need help collecting branches to add to our work!” barked Mrs. Beaver, though they could have sounded friendlier!

Without hesitation, Daisy and Pip got to work. Pip, forgetting his usual grumbling, helped push small branches and twigs. Daisy darted up and down, her tail swishing, searching for helpful sticks and arranging branches to make the perfect bundle! They continued working tirelessly.

Soon, after much labor, they had helped to make several branches.

When the dam was done, and with the added support of Daisy's twigs and Pip’s pushing help, they repaired it and the water began to subside. The beavers were overjoyed.

"You are truly helping beavers,” Mrs. Beaver cheered as the beavers got into place, "Thanks!"

Then, something extraordinary happened. A gleaming gem, this one sparkling with a silvery light, appeared beside the newly repaired dam. "That has to be the 'gift of help' gem!" exclaimed Daisy. "This brings us joy and will definitely keep the rest of our friends safer!"

Pip felt a deeper feeling of satisfaction this time. This warm feeling was different. "It's good to help out," he admitted, surprised at the feeling!

For the final gem, they went off to a meadow, with the map guiding them. It pointed toward a bright red poppy! "This is where we'll find the final gem: the gem of working together and the appreciation of all things!” said Daisy. “These creatures can help us with their advice!”

They arrived, and it was very apparent there were lots of creatures trying to come together, like bees, butterflies, and squirrels! Everything was not okay. "The bees and butterflies don’t like to agree!" whispered a frustrated rabbit. "Now everyone seems very unhappy. I am a rabbit and don't really get it.”

Daisy had a great idea. “Listen, Pip! If the flowers can't appreciate others' roles, there are going to be troubles!" she said, before announcing to the room “Everyone has to do all their part!”

Then, it started, “Bees!” exclaimed Daisy. "If we don't have any bees, our butterflies will have a lot less food! This affects you and me!" Daisy turned around to look at the butterflies. "It's like… sharing snacks and gifts!" she continued. "We appreciate the bees! Right?!"

Daisy did this for a little bit, until a few more people changed their minds and said that the butterflies appreciate the squirrels, who love berries!

Just then, as the group became unified with positive teamwork, a final Happiness Gem floated into existence! This gem glowed with a rainbow of colors, a truly magnificent sight. This, it looked like the “Unity” gem, represented finding happiness by coming together!

Pip couldn't help but smile, amazed by all the amazing things, despite feeling a little weird with the change! "I'm not so bad at making friends, now, and I actually kind of enjoyed everything,” said Pip.

Daisy beamed at him. "You see, Pip? It's wonderful helping other people!"

Daisy and Pip, each holding their gem and realizing there was more than one type of happiness to be found, returned home with light hearts and smiles! The forest felt like a more beautiful place.
