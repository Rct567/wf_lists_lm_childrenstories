<title>If I Could Paint the Sky, What Colors Would I Choose?</title>
<body>
Lily loved to paint. Not just on paper, or with crayons. Lily painted with her imagination. Her bedroom walls were covered in invisible sunflowers that bloomed every morning, and giggling clouds floated across her ceiling. But her biggest dream was to paint the sky.

One Tuesday, after a particularly boring spelling test (Lily knew she would miss at least five words, ‘pneumonia’ being one of the tricky ones), Lily sat on the grass in her garden, staring at the big, blank blue canvas above her.

“If I could paint the sky,” she sighed to her fluffy, white cat, Cloud, who was chasing a particularly bouncy ladybug, “What colors would I even choose?”

Cloud, mid-pounce, blinked at her as if to say, “Well, aren't you going to get on with it, then?”

Lily giggled. “You’re right, Cloud! Let’s decide!”

She closed her eyes and imagined squeezing the biggest, most wonderful tubes of paint she could find.

First, the mornings. Oh, the mornings! Lily pictured a sunrise that wasn't just yellow and orange. No, this would be something special. She'd start with a gentle wash of **Cotton Candy Pink**, like the sugary treat she got at the fair. Then, streaks of **Tangerine Tango**, a color so bright it made your tummy tingle with happiness. Over that, she would brush on **Golden Glitz**, shimmering like a thousand tiny treasures.

"Mmm, yes!" she whispered, her eyes still closed. "That's a good start!"

Next, the afternoons! They needed a special treatment, too. She'd need bold, vibrant colors. She squeezed the tube labeled **Dragonfruit Red**. She imagined a few feisty clouds puffed with energy and adventure, perhaps battling invisible pirates! Then came the **Emerald Enchantment**, green like the deepest jungle with hidden, friendly animals peeking through the trees. And, of course, for a bit of fun, splatters of **Electric Lime**, which danced on the air like silly, silly fireworks.

"Wonderful!" she breathed, "Just like the perfect playground!"

Cloud meowed in agreement, rubbing against Lily's legs.

But what about the sunsets? Ah, sunsets were the most magical part of the day! Lily felt she needed a palette to stir the emotions, and make sure all the animals were comfortable and went home peacefully for the night. For these, she needed a palette to stir the soul. She squeezed a tube of **Raspberry Riot**, a colour bursting with joyous energy. After, she used a hue that glowed like the best summer fruit, a generous splash of **Apricot Afterglow**. Lily imagined giant sleeping bunnies nestled into that. Finally, and in large brushstrokes, came the color **Indigo Dreams**, which helped people sleep peacefully.

“Ah,” she sighed, opening her eyes and gazing up at the ordinary, everyday blue sky, “the sunsets will be perfect!”

Then, there were the nights! Nights needed something different, a calming, dreamy blend. First, a base layer of **Lavender Lullaby**, a soothing shade that made you feel sleepy just looking at it. Next, shimmering stars! She poured out **Glitter Galaxy**, filled with sparkles that danced in the air, reflecting the sunlight. As a final touch, she added **Midnight Moon**, which would guide all the lost explorers and dreamers.

Lily sat and imagined painting these colours on the clouds. Some would look like cats. Some would look like dragons. Some might just look like giant balls of fluff!

“What about rain?” she suddenly wondered. Rain was tricky. It wasn't exactly a colour. "Hmm..."

She closed her eyes and pondered. Rain could be... **Bubble Gum Blues** when it fell light and gentle. It could also be **Stormy Slate**, when it roared with thunder! And when the sun peeked through, the drops could be **Rainbow Ripples**, with every color imaginable.

"Rain, too, is magical!" she concluded. Cloud purred, content with her creativity.

Suddenly, Lily heard a faint squeak. She looked down and saw a tiny little grasshopper, no bigger than her thumb. The grasshopper, its little legs twitching nervously, wore a tiny little hat and held a minuscule paintbrush.

"Excuse me," squeaked the grasshopper. "Are you painting the sky?"

Lily giggled. "Well, not *really*! Just in my imagination."

The grasshopper hopped closer. "I'm Pip! I help collect colours!" he said proudly. "I help all the creatures paint!"

"Really?" Lily asked, her eyes wide with wonder. "That's amazing! Do you really think I could, maybe... actually paint the sky?"

Pip adjusted his hat and looked up. “Of course you can! But you will need a lot of help, you know. More than any normal paintbrush can give.”

Lily looked at Pip, unsure. "How?" she asked.

"You have to go to the Rainbow Repository!" Pip squeaked. "It's where the clouds hold the colors for all things."

Lily looked up at the clouds, then at the bright sun, then at Cloud, who was chasing the grasshopper now. "The Rainbow Repository? But how do I get there?"

Pip smiled. "That, my friend, is where the magic begins!" He hopped onto a dandelion seed and gave it a little push. "Follow the dandelion!" he called as it drifted away into the sky. "And then..." he winked. "...Follow your heart!" And with that, Pip disappeared from her view.

Lily stared after the dandelion. Follow your heart. It sounded important, just like her grandma’s old instructions.

Taking a deep breath, she stood up and decided to follow the dandelion seed. She knew Cloud would follow. She imagined what it was like to actually paint the sky and smile. This was an adventure.

Following the floating dandelion seed, Lily wandered through her garden and down the street. The dandelion flew past Mr. Gable’s prize-winning roses, which made Lily think of **Ruby Red** and the other colours she had planned to use. It circled the tall oak tree in Mrs. Higgins’s yard, reminding her of **Jungle Green**.

Suddenly, the dandelion landed at the top of the biggest hill. Lily and Cloud made it up the hill, puffing, after a little time. Standing there, it seemed, was a rainbow bridge, stretching all the way into the sky!

As they crossed the rainbow bridge, it began to glow. Lily was in a trance and did not quite know where to look, but the bridge was gorgeous.

At the end of the rainbow bridge, the sky seemed even more gigantic than it did from her backyard. Floating in the middle of it were gigantic, fluffy clouds. And… they were talking!

“Oh, this **Cotton Candy Pink** is a delight!” one cloud boomed, its voice like rolling thunder.

“Don’t be shy! This **Emerald Enchantment** needs a little more blending,” chirped another, giggling.

And there, in front of her, floating in the sky, was a magnificent building with clouds holding all the colors. The biggest paint factory Lily had ever seen! It was the Rainbow Repository!

A big, fluffy cloud, wearing a tiny pair of glasses, drifted down to greet them. "Welcome! Welcome! We've been expecting you," the cloud boomed cheerfully. "I am Nimbus. You may call me Nimbus."

Nimbus led Lily and Cloud inside, where the most incredible thing happened. The paint colors she had imagined suddenly appeared. There were vats of **Cotton Candy Pink**, giant tubes of **Tangerine Tango**, and jars overflowing with **Glitter Galaxy** glitter! The Rainbow Repository contained the color that had always resided in Lily's imagination.

Nimbus gave Lily a giant paintbrush made of feathers and instructed her to paint whatever she could ever think of.

And that is exactly what Lily did. With the help of Cloud and the encouragement of the other clouds, she mixed and matched and created all kinds of amazing skies.

The sun rose every day, filled with **Tangerine Tango** and **Golden Glitz**. Rain fell in beautiful, glistening colours that Lily had imagined from before, as they dropped and splashed, and the stars shone with extra brilliance thanks to Lily’s touches of **Glitter Galaxy**

After a long day of painting the sky, Lily began to grow tired and her paintbrush hand fell on her lap, exhausted. It had taken a whole day, and then a whole evening, but the sky had been reborn. But then, just as the first shades of dawn appeared on the horizon, Nimbus cleared his throat. "My dear," he said gently, "It is now time to head home."

Lily did not know what to say, because she was so thankful for the chance to visit, but at the mention of home, she began to smile.

She woke up the next day to the sight of **Cotton Candy Pink** and **Tangerine Tango** filling the morning sky, but there was something different. As the sun's first light illuminated the sky, Lily was no longer painting the sky from the bottom of her garden, but she had already reached a magical cloud palace where she made many friends. And in her room, the invisible sunflowers on her wall, her imaginary friends, had changed into new colors that gave the room a vibrant hue, and reminded her of the beautiful task that lay before her.

Lily may have missed the spelling test on Tuesday, but at the very least, the real winner that day, she thought, would be the world! She stretched and gave a large yawn.

She had seen things, met friends, and she knew that wherever she had imagined and travelled on Tuesday, she knew, for sure, that her heart was leading her to where she needed to be. She was on a mission and could paint the world with the hues she selected, and the sky, of course, now with every color in the universe.

As she got ready for school, her heart bubbled over with new inspiration, and she even thought of the colours for the very important words of the Spelling Test, even as she giggled, knowing that those were coming as well!
