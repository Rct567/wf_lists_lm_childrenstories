<title>The Cloud That Cried Candy Floss</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, high above the rolling green hills and the bustling, colourful town of Sunnyville, lived a fluffy, white cloud named Cumulus. Cumulus wasn't just any cloud; he was known throughout the sky for his incredibly soft and marshmallowy appearance. Children down below would often point and shout, "Look! It's a giant marshmallow!"

Cumulus loved the children. He loved watching them play in the parks, build sandcastles on the beaches, and laugh as they chased the colourful kites that danced in the wind. He wanted to do something special for them, something that would make them smile and fill their days with even more joy.

One sunny morning, as the sun painted the sky with streaks of orange and pink, Cumulus felt a peculiar sensation. It started as a tickle, a tiny flutter deep inside. Then, a warm, sweet feeling spread throughout his fluffy form. Suddenly, a single, glistening tear rolled down his side. It wasn't just any tear; it was a shimmering, pink swirl of…candy floss!

The candy floss tear drifted down to Sunnyville, landing gently on the outstretched hand of a little girl named Lily. Lily gasped, her eyes wide with wonder. It was the most delicious candy floss she had ever tasted! News of the candy floss-crying cloud spread like wildfire. Soon, all the children of Sunnyville were gazing at Cumulus, hoping for their own sugary treat.

Cumulus, however, wasn't feeling quite right. The candy floss tears, while fun, were starting to drain him. He felt lighter, emptier, as if a piece of himself was disappearing with each sugary drop. He tried to stop crying, but the feeling wouldn't go away. More and more candy floss tears fell, covering the town in a sweet, pink layer.

The children, initially overjoyed, began to have problems. Their clothes were constantly sticky, their hair was perpetually a sugary mess, and even the streets became sticky and difficult to walk on. Everything was coated in candy floss. The playground slides became dangerously sticky, and the swings barely moved because of the sticky substance. Even the houses were slowly being covered in pink fluff.

Lily, remembering how much Cumulus loved them, was worried. She knew something wasn’t right. She gathered her friends, a curious and brave group including Tom, the quiet reader; Maya, the adventurous climber; and Sam, the inventive inventor, and they hatched a plan.

They knew they needed to reach Cumulus, to talk to him, to understand what was happening. The challenge was how. They couldn't fly, and a ladder wouldn't reach that high.

“We need something big!” exclaimed Maya, staring up at the cloud.

“And strong enough to reach the sky!” added Tom, adjusting his glasses.

Sam, thinking quickly, dashed off to his workshop. He returned a short while later, pushing a contraption that looked like a giant balloon made of clear plastic, supported by a metal frame, with a small cabin attached.

“I call it the Sky-Rider!” Sam announced proudly. “It's filled with a special gas that will make it float! And we'll use a super-strong cable to climb up when we get near Cumulus.”

The friends spent the rest of the day working tirelessly. They carefully assembled the Sky-Rider. As the sun began to set, painting the sky in even more vibrant colours, their creation was ready. They climbed into the small cabin, excited and slightly nervous.

With a hiss and a gentle lift, the Sky-Rider rose into the air. They floated over the sticky streets and the pink-covered houses. As they ascended, the air became thinner and colder. Cumulus, above them, seemed larger than ever.

Finally, they were close enough. Maya expertly navigated the cable and clipped it to a nearby cloud. Tom carefully began the climb, inching his way up towards Cumulus, while Lily and Sam waited in the cabin. The wind buffeted him, trying to pull him off the cable, but Tom held tight, determined to reach Cumulus.

Reaching the edge of the fluffy cloud, Tom looked around. He carefully observed Cumulus' face. He noticed Cumulus’ sad, cloudy expression and heard the quiet, sugary sobbing sound. Tom could tell Cumulus was unhappy.

He called out, "Cumulus! Are you alright? We're here to help!"

Cumulus stopped crying and, through the sticky candy floss surrounding him, slowly turned towards Tom. His voice was a soft, muffled rumble.

"I… I don't know what's happening," Cumulus replied. "I just… I just can't stop crying this sweet, sticky stuff."

Tom carefully pulled himself further onto the fluffy cloud, making sure he didn’t fall off and followed up with another question. "Do you feel… drained? Like you're losing something?"

Cumulus shuddered. “Yes! That's exactly how I feel! I’m so tired. And everything is… blurry."

Tom knew something was wrong. It sounded like Cumulus was unwell, like he had too much of something sweet inside, a huge build-up of happiness, possibly, that he couldn't control.

Tom decided to speak up, "Maybe… maybe you need to be emptied! Maybe you need something that takes away the sugary tears before you become completely empty."

He yelled to Lily and Sam below in the Sky-Rider cabin. "Sam, I need that thingamajig now!"

Sam had been busy in the cabin. He pointed to a large, metal contraption with a big net-like structure on top of it. He had worked on it non-stop during the journey, inventing something which he felt might help. He and Lily pulled the Sky-Rider, closer to Cumulus, by using the attached cables and the gentle wind currents in the air.

Carefully, Tom worked with Cumulus, steering him closer to the net-like structure. Slowly, the net began to catch the sugary tears as Cumulus wept.

Soon, a stream of pink candy floss started falling into the Sky-Rider's net. The cloud started to feel lighter and his tears turned back into clean rain. After a while, he was feeling much better. He began to shed normal, fluffy, non-sugary tears. The pink went away and the air was filled with a cool, gentle, rain.

Lily and Sam began pulling on the Sky-Rider's attached cable, back down towards the ground, carrying the huge net-ful of candy floss.

The children of Sunnyville, noticing the change in Cumulus and seeing the Sky-Rider descending, rushed towards the landing spot. They cheered as the Sky-Rider landed.

Carefully, the net of candy floss was lowered to the ground. It was an enormous mountain of sugary goodness!

"We should give it back to Cumulus!" shouted one small child. "We want Cumulus to feel better."

“I can help with that!” said Sam excitedly. He brought forward a large, hand-built ice cream maker. He, Lily and Tom started using the ice cream maker to slowly start spinning the mountain of candy floss. He used his ingenious inventions and created something special. He carefully placed delicious scoops of fluffy clouds, ice-cream, candy floss and lots of fun toppings, like gummy bears, chocolates, cookies and sprinklers into ice cream cones.

The children of Sunnyville and the children that created the plan ate, played and helped Cumulus and each other. They laughed and celebrated under the cool and fresh, non-sugary rain.

For weeks after, the town was filled with happiness and laughter. But best of all, they had learned to appreciate Cumulus even more. He wasn’t just the candy floss-crying cloud; he was their friend, and he was happy again. And whenever they saw Cumulus in the sky, they remembered their adventure, and they smiled, knowing they had helped their marshmallowy friend.
From that day on, Cumulus learned to control his emotions and to sometimes release his happy tears into fluffy, normal rain and was never quite so overloaded again, but the children were given candy floss on very special occasions. It was all thanks to the bravery of the children of Sunnyville. They learned that helping others and caring for each other was the sweetest reward of all.
The End.
