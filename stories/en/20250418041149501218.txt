<title>A Dragon Learning the Important Value of Good Deeds</title><body>Once upon a time, nestled amongst the rolling green hills and sparkling blue rivers, lived a young dragon named Sparky. Sparky wasn't like the other dragons in his family; they were all known for their booming roars, fiery breaths, and hoarding of shiny treasures. Sparky, on the other hand, was a bit… different. He loved to giggle, he had a fondness for butterflies, and his scales, instead of being a menacing crimson or emerald, were a shimmering, sunny yellow.

One sunny morning, Sparky’s mother, a very large and impressive dragon named Ember, boomed, "Sparky! Time for your dragon training! Today, we learn how to breathe fire and protect our hoard!"

Sparky sighed. He much preferred playing hide-and-seek with the fluffy white sheep that grazed on the hillsides. However, he knew he had to obey his mother, so he reluctantly followed her to the training grounds.

Ember showed him how to inhale deeply, clench his jaw, and… try to breathe fire. Sparky tried his best. He inhaled, clenched, and… let out a small puff of smoke.

"Again!" boomed Ember.

Sparky tried again, with the same result. Another puff of smoke. He tried and tried, but all he could manage was a few wisps of gray. Ember huffed, her own nostrils flaring slightly.

"Perhaps you need a little practice guarding the hoard, then," she said, sounding a bit disappointed. "We’ll start you on a small pile of shiny pebbles."

Sparky, relieved to be excused from fire-breathing, happily agreed. He sat beside the small pile of pebbles, meant to be his ‘treasure.’ But guarding wasn’t really Sparky’s thing. He got bored quickly. He much preferred to watch the clouds drift by, imagining them as giant fluffy sheep.

He spent the rest of the day daydreaming, and by the time his mother returned, the pebbles were scattered all over the ground. Ember was not pleased. "Sparky!" she thundered. "You're supposed to be guarding these pebbles! What happened?"

Sparky stammered, "I… I got a little distracted, Mama. I was watching the clouds. They looked like… like giant sheep!"

Ember sighed, a long, smoky exhale. "Sparky, being a dragon is about power, strength, and protecting what's ours. You need to focus!"

That night, feeling discouraged, Sparky sat on a small hill overlooking the valley. He saw a village below, with tiny houses and little people bustling about. He saw children laughing and playing, and he felt a pang of loneliness. He wished he could be friends with them. But he knew, a yellow dragon, unable to breathe fire, who liked watching clouds, wouldn't exactly be welcomed by the villagers.

The next day, Sparky was sent to the river to get water. He grumbled as he trudged along, dragging a large bucket. Suddenly, he heard a small cry. He peered around and saw a small, fluffy lamb trapped in a thorny bush. It was bleating piteously.

Now, a good, fire-breathing dragon would probably ignore the lamb. A strong dragon might use its claws to free the lamb, heedless of the thorns. But Sparky, remembering his cloud-sheep and his own loneliness, knew what he wanted to do.

He carefully, very carefully, used his yellow claws to gently pull the thorny branches away from the lamb. It bleated again, then, free from the thorns, it nuzzled against his leg. Sparky smiled, a real, genuine smile that reached his sunny-yellow eyes.

He then remembered the water bucket and decided he could help the lamb find some water.

That afternoon, a little girl named Lily was walking home from the market when she noticed the little lamb, which looked rather sad and weary, sitting by the side of the road. It began to start bleating and then she heard someone coming her way and thought it would be her best friend. She noticed it was Sparky, the dragon who lived up the hill, and the lamb's eyes lit up immediately.

"Hello there", said Sparky gently as the lamb ran to greet Lily.
"Wow you can talk!"
"Yes of course I can speak!"
"Well the lamb's just told me you were the one to help her."
"You can understand Lamb?"
"Well the lamb and I have grown very close."

Lily was a bit surprised. She had always been told dragons were scary, fire-breathing creatures. But Sparky seemed… nice. And he had helped the lamb. Lily thought that was very sweet of him.

The following days became a pattern. Sparky continued his "training" but also sought out ways to help others. He helped a farmer mend a broken fence. He used his surprisingly gentle claws to untangle a kite that was stuck in a tall tree for a group of children. He even used the small puff of smoke he could manage to gently dry some freshly washed clothes hanging on a line when it started to drizzle.

The villagers, initially wary of the yellow dragon, began to see that Sparky wasn’t so scary after all. They saw him helping and being kind. Lily began to visit Sparky every day to help him or have him assist. Sometimes she brought the little lamb, too. They’d sit and talk, and Lily would tell Sparky stories about her life and she would assist the dragon. Sparky found joy in this companionship, this friendship.

One day, a terrible storm raged through the valley. The wind howled, the rain poured, and the river swelled, threatening to flood the village. The villagers were frightened, but they didn't know what to do. Many began gathering up their valuables, including the village’s stash of coins.

Suddenly, a bridge over the river collapsed! Panic ensued. The only way to save the village was to divert the river, but the water was flowing too quickly and no one was brave enough to get in and assist with any solution.

Then, Lily had an idea. "Sparky!" she cried, "can you help?"

The villagers, huddled in their homes, looked up. They knew what to do but they hoped the dragon would understand what they needed!

Sparky didn’t hesitate. Remembering how he was unable to control fire, and also knew his abilities didn’t extend much further, he knew exactly what to do. He knew he could assist, in his own unique way. He was big, much bigger than anyone in the village, and strong. He ran to the riverbank and stood in front of the villagers, who looked on in fear.

He then, using his great strength and size, started to build a wall around the side of the valley, which protected the village from the worst of the flood! He began creating the barrier and continued through the whole night. 

The villagers quickly came to help him. He was making a big impact to helping with the valley and eventually protecting everyone around him. As the sun rose, and the storm began to subside, everyone knew that the village would survive the catastrophe and everything would work out for the better. The villagers worked together all throughout the morning to complete the project.

Exhausted but exhilarated, Sparky watched the villagers cheer. Lily, the little lamb, the farmer and all the children came to greet him.

Ember arrived as well and it would be her first encounter with the village! She hadn’t spoken to anyone in years as she liked the peace. As she went down and took a look at Sparky’s effort, she realized he really wasn’t just guarding treasure - he guarded his friends.

She spoke to the villagers, "I never wanted my son to be different or have him make friends but I see his friends have assisted with this important task!"

Sparky had truly found his role. The villagers welcomed her too.
“We did nothing wrong," Ember said, "to the villagers. You are all safe."

She spoke to Sparky with pride and looked at him. "Your actions protected everyone. And to be honest, he still doesn't know what fire breathing is but he knows the important values - more than the rest of our family!"

Later, when the storm had passed completely, and the river returned to normal, Ember approached Sparky with a smile she rarely showed.

“Sparky,” she said, her voice surprisingly gentle, “you've made us all proud. You didn't need fire to protect others. Your kindness, your bravery, and your willingness to help others are a true strength."

Sparky grinned, his sunny-yellow scales sparkling in the sun. He was surrounded by friends, the villagers and his mother all looking at him and celebrating his deeds. He hadn't hoarded treasures. He hadn't roared a terrifying roar. He had simply been himself, a dragon who cared.

From that day on, Sparky continued to help the villagers. He helped the farmer, as well as the baker to mix ingredients. He made sure every kid, and even everyone had a treat! The other dragons, curious, and very slowly, they too learned the importance of kindness, of helping others. The village became known for more than just rolling hills and sparkling rivers; it became known for its kindness, all thanks to the yellow dragon, Sparky, who had shown everyone that the greatest treasure of all wasn’t gold or jewels, but good deeds. And so, Sparky and his friends continued to live happily ever after, proving that being different could be the most wonderful thing in the world.
