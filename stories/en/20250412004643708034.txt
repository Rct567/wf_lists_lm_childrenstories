<title>Henry Hippo's Helpful Habit of Giving High-Fives.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst tall, green reeds and sparkling blue water, lived a hippopotamus named Henry. Henry wasn’t just any hippopotamus; he was a very happy hippopotamus. He had a wide, friendly smile, a cheerful disposition, and a wonderful habit of giving high-fives.

Every morning, as the sun peeked over the acacia trees, painting the sky with shades of orange and pink, Henry would wake up with a bounce in his step. He would stretch his big, grey body, yawn a big, hippo yawn, and then begin his day. His favourite part of the day was meeting all his friends in the swamp and giving them a special high-five.

The first creature Henry usually saw was Penelope Parrot. Penelope was a very chatty bird, with bright, colourful feathers and a love for juicy mangoes. Henry would spot her perched on a branch, preening her feathers.

“Good morning, Penelope!” Henry would call out in his booming voice.

Penelope would chirp excitedly, “Good morning, Henry! What a lovely day!”

Then, Henry would raise his massive, paddle-like hand, and Penelope would flap her wing to meet it. “High-five!” Henry would roar with laughter, and Penelope would giggle, fluttering her wings even more.

Next, Henry would waddle towards the muddy bank of the river, where Finley Frog loved to spend his mornings. Finley was a small, green frog with big, bulging eyes and an even bigger appetite for juicy flies. He'd often be sitting on a lily pad, patiently waiting for breakfast.

“Hello, Finley!” Henry would bellow, approaching the lily pad.

Finley, startled for a moment, would leap into the air, then realize it was just Henry. "Morning, Henry," he'd croak, "Beautiful day for catching flies, wouldn't you agree?"

Henry would chuckle and hold out his hand. "Absolutely! How about a high-five before you start?"

Finley, always eager for a bit of fun, would jump onto Henry's palm. "High-five!" he'd squeak with delight, feeling the slight tingle from Henry's touch.

As Henry continued his morning rounds, he'd encounter other friends. There was Sally Snake, who, despite her cold blood, always gave a surprisingly warm high-five with a quick, flicking movement of her long body. There was Barnaby Bear, a large, fluffy creature who usually preferred a gentle pat but made an exception for Henry's exuberant high-fives. He’d give Henry's hand a friendly, yet firm slap. Then, of course, there was Sammy Snail, the slowest of them all, who gave a high-five at a snail’s pace, leaving Henry giggling and saying, "Slow and steady, Sammy!"

Henry's high-fives weren't just for fun, though. He had noticed that whenever he gave a high-five, his friends seemed happier, and things seemed to go smoother. He'd watch Finley Frog leap higher after a high-five, he saw Penelope Parrot sing louder after a high-five, and Sally Snake's slithering was even smoother.

One particularly gloomy morning, the sun hid behind thick, grey clouds, and the swamp felt unusually still. Penelope Parrot was sulking on her branch. Her colourful feathers seemed dull, and she wasn't singing her usual cheerful melodies.

"Good morning, Penelope," Henry said, his voice full of his usual cheer.

Penelope just grumbled, "Not a good morning, Henry. It’s too cloudy, and I don't feel like singing."

Henry, noticing her unhappiness, knew what to do. He held out his hand. "How about a high-five to chase those clouds away?"

Penelope hesitated, her eyes a little brighter. Then, with a small smile, she met Henry's hand. “High-five!” Henry boomed, and Penelope giggled, her spirits instantly lifting. She ruffled her feathers, took a deep breath, and began to sing a beautiful, bright tune. The whole swamp seemed to perk up!

Later that day, Henry found Finley Frog looking very worried. A strong wind had blown away all of his favourite lily pads, and he didn’t know how he was going to find a good place to sit and catch flies.

"What's wrong, Finley?" Henry asked kindly.

Finley sighed. "The wind blew away all my lily pads, and now I have nowhere to sit!"

Henry thought for a moment. Then, he had an idea. He used his powerful nose to nudge a few logs towards the side of the river. He carefully positioned them together. Then, with the help of some floating reeds and strong mud, he built a sturdy platform.

"Here you go, Finley!" Henry announced proudly. "A brand-new place to sit!"

Finley hopped onto the platform, his eyes wide with surprise and happiness. "Oh, Henry! Thank you! Thank you so much!"

Henry raised his hand, a smile spreading across his face. "How about a high-five to celebrate?"

Finley jumped onto Henry’s palm. "High-five!" he cried, his worries completely forgotten.

That afternoon, Barnaby Bear stumbled over to Henry with a very serious expression. "Henry," he began, "I seem to have lost my favourite honey pot."

Henry knew how much Barnaby loved his honey. He thought for a moment. Then, remembering where Barnaby usually left the honey pot, he lumbered towards the area. There it was, trapped behind a thorny bush. It looked quite hard to reach. Henry thought carefully. He stretched as far as he could, and using his strong, clumsy snout, managed to wiggle the honey pot free from the bush without breaking it.

Barnaby gasped. "You found it! Oh, Henry, you're a lifesaver!"

Henry brought him the honey pot with care. Barnaby was overcome with relief. “Thank you, Henry! Thank you!"

Henry beamed. He held out his hand. "High-five for rescuing the honey?"

Barnaby, still smiling, gave a hearty slap. “High-five!” he boomed with a joyful noise.

Soon, other animals started asking Henry for high-fives whenever they were feeling sad, or stressed, or simply to start their day. He even began giving high-fives when his friends weren't feeling anything. He offered one to Sally Snake on a very good, sunny afternoon, and another to Sammy Snail when he seemed very proud of moving across a small mud patch! Henry’s helpful habit became known throughout the whole swamp. It wasn't long before it spread to other swamps, too, and soon everyone loved a high-five.

Henry Hippo’s helpful habit made a difference in the lives of all the creatures he knew. They started to rely on him and to know that whatever happened, the high-five could help.

And so, every day, Henry continued to give his high-fives. He always remembered to include Sammy Snail, even though the high-five often took ages. He always kept a high-five reserved for a sunny afternoon, and another one for those times when he felt happy. His happy habit spread, and every creature, big or small, knew that a high-five from Henry was always a good thing. And so, in his own happy, helpful way, Henry Hippo brought smiles and joy to the entire swamp. And every day, he looked forward to all the high-fives the new day would bring!
