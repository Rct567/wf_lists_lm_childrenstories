<title>Ruby Reads Remarkable Riddles</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled beside a whispering willow tree in a town brimming with blooming bluebells and chattering chipmunks, lived a young girl named Ruby. Ruby wasn't like the other children in town. While they chased butterflies and climbed the highest apple trees, Ruby preferred the company of books. Books were her dearest friends, filled with faraway lands, courageous knights, and, most of all, riddles.

Ruby's room wasn't filled with toys, but with towering stacks of books. Dusty tomes, shiny new picture books, and well-worn paperbacks lined every available shelf, each one holding a universe of stories. Her favourite kind, however, were the ones with riddles. Ruby loved the challenge of deciphering them, the way her mind would twist and turn, searching for the hidden answer.

One blustery autumn afternoon, as leaves of crimson and gold danced outside her window, Ruby discovered a particularly intriguing book. It was bound in a leather so old, it felt almost like the skin of a forgotten friend. On its cover, in elegant, swirling gold lettering, was the title: "Remarkable Riddles for Remarkable Readers." Intrigued, Ruby settled into her favourite armchair, a comfortable, well-loved piece, and opened the book.

The first riddle read: "I have cities, but no houses, forests, but no trees, and water, but no fish. What am I?" Ruby pondered. She chewed her lip, her brow furrowed in concentration. She thought of maps, diagrams, and even the school globe. Then, a tiny spark of understanding flickered in her mind. "A map!" she exclaimed aloud, a wide smile spreading across her face.

Each riddle presented a new and delightful puzzle. Ruby read of things invisible yet ever-present, of what has an eye, but cannot see. She laughed at the silly ones and carefully considered the thoughtful ones. As she continued to read, a sense of quiet joy washed over her. She wasn't just reading; she was embarking on a grand adventure, one riddle at a time.

However, as the weeks turned into months, a shadow began to fall over Ruby's happy world. Her grandmother, a kind woman with twinkling eyes and a warm embrace, began to fall ill. Grandma Elsie, who used to bake Ruby delicious apple pies and read her bedtime stories filled with singing stars and talking animals, could barely sit up in bed. Ruby would visit her every day, her heart heavy with worry.

Grandma Elsie was losing her memory, forgetting things she knew and loved. Sometimes she wouldn't recognize Ruby, or would call her by the wrong name. This was the most difficult of all. Ruby’s once bright eyes began to cloud over with sadness. The joy of the riddles, once so vibrant, began to fade.

One afternoon, Ruby sat by her grandmother's bedside, watching the older woman drift in and out of sleep. The air was thick with a quiet stillness. Ruby’s small hands clasped her grandmother's frail ones. She didn’t know what to do or say anymore. She just wanted to help, to make her feel better.

As she sat there, her gaze fell upon a worn, leather-bound book resting on Grandma Elsie's nightstand. It was the very book Ruby had discovered a few months before – "Remarkable Riddles for Remarkable Readers." A faint idea, a whisper of hope, stirred within her.

Very gently, Ruby picked up the book. She opened it and, with a shaky voice, began to read. "I am always in front of you, but can't be seen. What am I?"

Grandma Elsie stirred. Her eyes, usually distant, seemed to sharpen for a moment. She squeezed Ruby's hand weakly.

"The future," Ruby whispered, her voice trembling slightly.

Ruby read another riddle: "What has an eye, but cannot see?"

Grandma Elsie blinked, her brow furrowing in thought. Then, slowly, with a faint smile, she answered, "A needle."

Ruby’s heart leaped. She continued reading, her voice growing stronger with each riddle. Each correct answer brought a spark of recognition back to Grandma Elsie's eyes, a fleeting moment of clarity. It was as if the riddles, like tiny keys, were unlocking doors to her memory.

"I am lighter than a feather, but even the strongest man can't hold me for five minutes. What am I?"

This time, it was Ruby who needed a moment. She knew this one from memory, but hesitated. She looked at her grandmother, whose face was drawn with effort. "Breath," she finally said, the answer forming on her lips.

Slowly, bit by bit, day by day, the riddles became their special time. Ruby would read to her grandmother, and together, they would solve the puzzles. It wasn't a cure, not by any means, but it was a connection. It was a way for them to be together, even as the illness clouded her grandmother's mind. The riddles offered a temporary reprieve, a gentle escape from the reality of her illness.

One day, Ruby read, her voice thick with unshed tears, "What belongs to you, but others use it more than you do?"

Grandma Elsie gazed at Ruby, her eyes shining. After a long pause, she managed to whisper, "Your name." Then, with a weary sigh, she closed her eyes.

Ruby continued to read, but this time, it felt different. The riddles weren't bringing answers anymore. There was no flicker of recognition in Grandma Elsie's eyes. They just lay there, serene. As Ruby's sobs began, her grip around the fragile hand of her grandmother got firmer.
The following day, with the bluebells in full bloom and the chipmunks merrily chattering away outside the window, Grandma Elsie peacefully closed her eyes for the last time. The house, usually filled with warmth and laughter, now felt silent and still, the world around them a sea of blue, purple, and every colour in between.

Ruby was heartbroken. She missed her grandmother's hugs, her stories, and the delicious aroma of apple pie baking in the oven. But even through her tears, Ruby realized something important. The riddles, though a temporary haven, were still a treasure. They had helped her connect with her grandmother in her final days and moments. They were a symbol of their love, their shared laughter, their bond.

Ruby hugged the leather-bound book close to her chest. Now, as the grief subsided, she found new power in the riddles. She vowed to read them aloud again, always. As she grew older, the riddles in the book turned into memories. They held the scent of Grandma Elsie’s perfume, her laughter and her loving touch. They stood to tell the story of love and of her precious memories. Ruby continued to share the Remarkable Riddles with anyone she met. It became a bridge of communication between her, the townspeople, and also new children.

And so, Ruby continued to read her Remarkable Riddles. Not just for herself, but to honor the memory of her grandmother. She realized that the true meaning of a riddle wasn't just about finding the right answer, but about the journey you take while seeking it. It was about love, loss, memory, and the extraordinary connection she shared with her beloved grandmother. She found comfort in the puzzles.

She remembered the day she read "What is always coming, but never arrives?" and her grandmother answering with a quiet and satisfied smile, "Tomorrow." And even though, tomorrow would never come the same way again, Ruby would remember her forever.
