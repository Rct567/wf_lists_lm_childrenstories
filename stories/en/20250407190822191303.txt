<title>The Journey to the Land Where Lollipops Liberate Lost Laughs.</title><body>Barnaby Button was, by all accounts, a very ordinary boy. He had two arms, two legs, a nose that wiggled when he sneezed, and a very, very serious frown. Barnaby hadn’t laughed in… well, he couldn’t actually remember. Not for a very, very long time. His smiles were shy, like little field mice, popping out only when absolutely certain the coast was clear, and promptly retreating back to the safety of Barnaby's serious face.

This lack of laughter wasn't because Barnaby didn't enjoy things. He loved building elaborate Lego castles, and he thought broccoli florets looked like tiny, funny trees. But somewhere along the way, Barnaby's laughter had gone missing, vanished without a trace like a misplaced sock. He missed it terribly.

One particularly grey Tuesday, as the rain hammered against his windowpane, Barnaby was hunched over his breakfast of porridge, trying to construct a fort out of his soggy Weetabix. A tiny, glittering envelope, the color of a rainbow after a particularly joyful shower, landed with a *plink* on the table. Barnaby, usually too preoccupied with being serious to notice such things, saw the glitter and, driven by a sudden, inexplicable spark of curiosity, picked it up.

Inside, written in bubbly, rainbow-colored ink, was a note. It read:

“Dearest Barnaby,

We hear you’ve lost your laughter. Don’t worry, it's simply gone on a holiday! It’s vacationing in the Land Where Lollipops Liberate Lost Laughs! Come visit! Follow the trail of shimmering snail trails! They’ll guide you.

Yours in Giggles,

The Lollipop League.”

Barnaby blinked. A Land where Lollipops did things and a league of gigglers? This was, admittedly, highly unusual. He squinted at the window, where a trail of silver snail trails indeed seemed to be leading away across the now-less-menacing rain. He cautiously swallowed the remainder of his porridge, then, armed with an adventurous feeling (and an umbrella, just in case the weather turned even grumpier), decided to follow.

The trail led him through his own garden, past Mrs. Higgins’ prize-winning petunias (which Barnaby carefully avoided stomping on, remembering his solemn commitment to following directions), and into the Whispering Woods. The Whispering Woods was called such for a very good reason; the trees were always rustling secrets to the wind, secrets only the truly curious could understand.

The silver snail trails sparkled against the damp leaves, occasionally disappearing and then reappearing, like mischievous sprites playing hide-and-seek. Barnaby, despite himself, started to feel a tiny tingle in his toes. Was this…fun? He even started to hum a little tune, the words escaping his lips almost involuntarily.

The path snaked deeper and deeper into the woods. Along the way, Barnaby encountered various creatures. There was a Squirrel named Squeaky, who insisted on telling Barnaby the history of every single acorn in the vicinity. Squeaky, upon realizing that Barnaby wasn’t giggling, looked at him with a rather confused air and offered him a perfectly ripe chestnut. Barnaby accepted it, which in turn prompted Squeaky to relate, at great length, a comprehensive account of what one does with a chestnut, at which point Barnaby started to *almost* smile.

Next, he came across a grumpy Badger named Bartholomew, who was terribly, utterly obsessed with collecting pebbles. Bartholomew huffed and puffed and, in a gravelly voice, complained about the scarcity of the “perfect” pebble. Barnaby, surprisingly, helped him find one, a wonderfully smooth, grey specimen. Bartholomew, initially shocked by the offer of assistance from the seemingly very serious child, started chuckling. Seeing this, Barnaby couldn't resist it either, and then *he* chuckled too!

The path, guided by the ever-shimmering trails, eventually opened into a clearing. And what a clearing it was! The air hummed with a sugary sweetness, and the ground was paved with enormous, swirling lollipops of every color imaginable. Giant gingerbread houses with candy-cane chimneys stood clustered about, and the whole landscape thrummed with a giddy energy.

This, without a doubt, was the Land Where Lollipops Liberate Lost Laughs!

Barnaby stood, wide-eyed, completely forgetting to be serious for the moment. Before him, was a grand welcoming party hosted by members of the Lollipop League. The League members looked identical, a joyful army, resembling walking, talking, gaily colored lollipops themselves. Each lollipop had a face and could, surprisingly, chat amongst themselves.

"Welcome, Barnaby!" cried the first lollipop, its flavor bubblegum. "We've been expecting you!"

“And why were you expecting him?” asked a sour-apple lollipop in a rather stern voice.

"Silly Sally," answered the bubblegum lollipop, with an impatient roll of its licorice eyes, “Don’t you see the sparkle of our little visitor? His laughter simply went on holiday. It's coming back!"

The lollipop army cheered at this declaration. A particularly plump lollipop, tasting suspiciously like chocolate-fudge, pushed to the front. "Welcome, Barnaby! My name is Chewy. To liberate your laughter, you must complete the Lollipop Challenge!"

The Lollipop Challenge, it turned out, involved three trials designed to coax out any and all missing laughs:

**Trial One: The Giggle Garden Game:** This was a vast garden filled with the silliest plants imaginable. There were giggle-grass that tickled, and blobfish blooms that made Barnaby feel like he was breathing under the sea, along with flowers which whistled and hummed the silliest of tunes. Barnaby, carefully observing the game at the insistence of the team of lollipops following him, eventually fell into a fit of giggles as the tickle grass began to play tricks.

**Trial Two: The Bouncing Biscuit Bridge:** This was a wobbly bridge constructed entirely of gingerbread biscuits (and guarded by a very sleepy Gumdrop Goblin), and the only way across was to bounce your way along. Each bounce was rewarded with a burst of brightly coloured sprinkles that made everything a lot more joyful. At first, Barnaby was hesitant, his serious nature resisting such a display of ridiculousness. Then, Chewy, who kept dropping by his side to encourage him, convinced him to jump up. And that’s when the giggles started to return.

**Trial Three: The Lollypop League Laff-Off:** This was the hardest trial of all, where each member of the Lollipop League took turns attempting to make Barnaby laugh. Some told jokes, some sang silly songs, and some performed outrageously clumsy magic tricks. Barnaby’s serious face started to crack. He gasped, he snorted, he managed a small, tentative smile.

Then, it happened. The chocolate-fudge lollipop, Chewy, tripped, mid-juggling act, dropping all its colourful pins into a puddle of cream. A startled silence descended over the room. And then Barnaby, without any warning whatsoever, let out a full-blown, unrestrained, side-splitting, joyful **burst** of laughter! The sound echoed throughout the Land, a glorious symphony of happy-ness.

All the lollipops in the hall cheered wildly. Barnaby had done it! He'd found his lost laughter.

The rest of the day was spent feasting on lollipop delights. Barnaby ate a giant strawberry-flavored lollipop and listened to the story of the land and how laughter comes back if you simply follow the snail trails. He was a very different boy on his trip back home. His shoes, no longer burdened by the frown, had a bit more spring in them, and he hummed all the way to the Whispering Woods. He said goodbye to the friends he made, and the entire forest whispered a joyful farewell, delighted to finally hear such happy sounds emanating from it.

When he got back to his house, the rainbow glitter envelope that brought him here sat on the kitchen table. He picked it up and thought, 'why did they not remind me sooner!'

He walked back to his room, and found the trail of shimmering snail trails ended, right there at the end of his bed. And beside his pillow lay, a very shiny new Lollipop, made especially to say welcome back to laughter, with the sweetest caramel and sea-salt flavoring he'd ever had.

The world seemed to have a brighter color about it, as the sun, a shy friend, decided that he, also, would return. As Barnaby built his next Lego castle, this time with the joy of every color imaginable, he looked around at the world with twinkling eyes. He knew, even on the most challenging day, a good giggle, was just around the corner. And every day, he smiled. His smiles were no longer shy. They were friends who loved to visit. He knew, he may go back and visit, whenever he found himself serious. But for now, the fun was to stay. He knew, the secret to all the worlds was out there, waiting. All you needed, was to search for joy, or even follow the trail of the snails. He laughed again, as the rain outside started to make a trail. He giggled, he whooped, he guffawed, he chuckled. Barnaby Button was no longer a serious boy. He was simply Barnaby, and now, he had a whole lot of laughter to share.
