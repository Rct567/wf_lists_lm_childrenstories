<title>Keeping Kindly Kites Kindly Keeping Calm</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amidst rolling green hills and shimmering blue rivers, lived a small, vibrant town called Flutterfield. In Flutterfield, the most beloved pastime wasn't playing hide-and-seek, nor was it baking yummy cupcakes – although those were enjoyed too! The true joy of Flutterfield’s inhabitants was flying kites. Every sunny day, the sky would be a dazzling dance of color, filled with kites of all shapes and sizes: dragons breathing rainbow fire, butterflies with gossamer wings, and even simple squares painted with cheerful faces.

The best kite-flyers in Flutterfield were a group of four kind friends: Lily, a clever girl with braids that bounced as she ran; Tom, a brave boy with a knack for knot-tying; Daisy, a gentle soul with a love for art; and Ben, a quick-witted boy who knew every cloud formation in the sky. They weren't just good at flying kites; they were also committed to being kind and considerate. They believed that even kites needed to be kept kind, and that kindness was the key to a happy kite-flying experience.

One day, a new kite arrived in Flutterfield. It was a magnificent kite shaped like a fierce, roaring lion, with a mane of bright orange and yellow. It belonged to a grumpy, grumpy goose named Gregory. Gregory wasn’t known for his kindness. He often grumbled, complained, and seemed determined to spoil everyone’s fun. He'd squawk at other kites in mid-air, trying to push them out of the best wind currents.

Lily, Tom, Daisy, and Ben were curious about Gregory's kite. They knew that if Gregory, with his grumpy attitude, didn’t learn to be calm and kind, his kite would be lonely, tangling with others, and would quickly fall from the sky. They decided to help.

“Let’s show Gregory how much fun kite-flying can be when you are kind,” said Lily, adjusting her own kite, a pretty pink butterfly.

Tom, ever the strategist, suggested, “We should teach him some calming techniques, like focusing on breathing and relaxing.”

Daisy, ever the artist, declared, “And we can use our kites to show how important it is to play nicely.”

Ben, with his knowledge of the wind, added, “We’ll help him find the best spots and encourage him to use the wind effectively.”

The four friends approached Gregory. “Hello, Gregory,” Lily greeted him kindly.

Gregory grumbled, his eyes narrowed. “What do you want?”

“We noticed your lion kite,” said Tom, pointing at the magnificent creature. “It's very impressive!”

“It’s supposed to be,” Gregory huffed.

“We thought we might offer some friendly kite-flying tips,” Daisy said gently.

Gregory hesitated, but his curiosity got the better of him. “Tips? What kind of tips?”

“Well,” Ben began, “The first thing is to be calm. A shaky hand can make your kite wobble and crash. Try taking deep breaths when you’re getting ready to launch, like this.” Ben demonstrated, inhaling slowly through his nose and exhaling slowly through his mouth.

Gregory scoffed, but Lily and Tom followed suit. Soon, the three of them were breathing deeply, the air filled with a gentle whooshing sound. Even the grumpy goose, somewhat against his will, found himself feeling a little less grumpy.

“Now, let’s try to get that lion up in the air,” said Tom.

Gregory, still feeling skeptical, began to prepare. He struggled, yanking on the string and grumbling to himself. His lion kite jerked and lurched, barely managing to lift off the ground.

“Here, let me help you,” Tom offered. Tom’s knot tying skills came to the forefront. Tom expertly untangled the kite string and showed Gregory how to hold the kite, giving it the appropriate amount of slack as he ran.

As Tom helped Gregory, the other friends started their kites flying. Daisy and Lily’s kites performed beautiful dances together. Ben knew the exact position to allow his kite to get the right wind, showing off his aerial dance skills.

“Look at how our kites are soaring harmoniously together," said Daisy. “That’s what you can accomplish if you focus on play instead of rivalry!”

Gregory started to feel less frustrated, but the wind changed. The sun was getting a little too hot, causing him to want to hide, not get involved in kite-flying. He felt a wave of anger coming. Suddenly, Gregory felt his hand starting to shake, his fingers clenching on the kite string. His lion kite dipped and swerved.

"It's too hot. I want to go!" he almost yelled at his kite.

Ben, with his knowledge of the wind, quickly assessed the situation. "Sometimes the wind is just too unpredictable! It's important to recognize the conditions and know when to give your kite a rest, so you can come back stronger!"

“Remember our deep breaths, Gregory,” Lily reminded him softly.

Tom added, “And how important is is to relax!”

Taking a deep breath, as he'd been shown, Gregory calmed down a bit and looked at the sun setting. Slowly but surely, the calming techniques seemed to be working. He wasn't screaming or cursing. He looked around him and focused on Tom’s, Daisy's, Lily's, and his kite's motions.

Gregory slowly breathed and looked at the way the wind was impacting his kite. "You're right,” he admitted. “It does help when I try to relax and pay attention to the way my kite moves. It really is best when you take your time and look for the best weather conditions.”

As Gregory started to grasp the importance of calming his mind, Lily had a helpful idea: “Gregory, would you like to see if we can share the sky? Sometimes it's better to let some kites soar around and relax, not getting too close."

With everyone in the group, they developed a plan to avoid kite tangling.

Together, the friends created a system to make the air peaceful:

First, they agreed to share the sky, providing time and space for each kite to be its best. No cutting other people’s kites or forcing their own kites in.
Second, they decided to signal whenever one kite would cut others off.

Gregory decided to try, taking in their thoughts and using it to see how to avoid kite tangling. After a while, his lion began to dance smoothly in the sky. He managed to fly next to the friends and watched the various motions and designs with his own kite. It really made kite-flying an amazing experience.

That day, Gregory finally started to relax, understanding how important kindness was.

Over the next few days, Lily, Tom, Daisy, and Ben continued to help Gregory. They worked on improving his skills and encouraged him to be kind, just as he would keep his kites calm. He still grumbled from time to time, but each time, he remembered to breathe deeply. He understood the value of cooperation, of being patient with himself, and of using calming techniques in kite flying.

Slowly but surely, the lion kite’s mane became a symbol of his calm progress. The orange and yellow colors danced through the air more gracefully. Gregory's grumpy demeanor started to soften, and he even smiled.

One sunny afternoon, Gregory’s lion kite soared in the sky alongside the others. He was helping Lily's kite, and Tom's kite, without getting tangled. He showed everyone what kind and proper flight patterns were needed. When his own kite nearly went off course, he remembered the deep breathing exercises, he found the right air currents, and steered it back to the right location. He laughed a little, feeling happy to join in, not compete or make others feel upset.

"Thank you," Gregory said to Lily, Tom, Daisy, and Ben, a real smile spreading across his face. “You helped me understand that kindness and calm are just as important as any trick in the sky. My kite and I are a lot happier!"

The four friends beamed with pride. They had shown Gregory that it wasn’t enough to just fly a kite; it was how you flew your kite that mattered.

From that day on, the skies of Flutterfield were even more joyful. Gregory’s lion kite, now a symbol of kindness, danced with the other kites, and every child in Flutterfield, young and old, was a reminder to them that to Keep Kindly Kites Kindly Keeping Calm required patience, understanding, and a little bit of help from good friends. And sometimes, that made all the difference. The kites flew higher and the friendships were more colorful than before.
