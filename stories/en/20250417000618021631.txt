<title>A Friendly Dragon and the Girl Who Loved Singing Songs</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a valley painted with emerald green meadows and sparkling sapphire rivers, lived a little girl named Elara. Elara wasn't like the other children in her village; she carried a song in her heart, a melody that danced upon her lips and tumbled out as she skipped through the wildflowers. Her voice, clear as a mountain stream, filled the air with joyous tunes, tales of brave knights and whispering willows, of sun-drenched fields and twinkling stars.

But the village of Oakhaven, though charming, was also shadowed by a deep, persistent worry. This was because, atop the highest peak, lived a dragon. Not a fire-breathing, maiden-snatching dragon, no. This dragon was different. He was, according to the villagers, a grumpy, grumpy beast named Ignis. His presence cast a long, chilling shadow over their lives. They rarely ventured far from their homes, whispering of rumbling growls and fiery glares whenever the mountain wind seemed to howl a little too fiercely.

Elara, however, didn't fear Ignis. She had heard the stories, of course, but she imagined a different dragon, a lonely one, perhaps in need of a friend. Every morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of pink and gold, Elara would climb a small hill, a small, gentle slope facing the mountain, and sing. She sang of sunshine and laughter, of the joy of the open fields, of the beauty she found in every rustling leaf and fluttering butterfly.

Her songs were carried on the wind, drifting towards the craggy mountain peak, where, unbeknownst to Elara, Ignis was indeed listening.

Ignis, a dragon of magnificent emerald scales and eyes like molten gold, wasn't grumpy by nature. He was, in fact, deeply saddened by his own isolation. He remembered a time, long ago, when he had friends, when laughter had echoed through his own caverns, when the world felt bright and filled with possibilities. But then, his friends were gone, victims of a terrible, unseen illness, and the joy drained from him, replaced by a deep, throbbing loneliness.

He'd retreated to the mountaintop, wanting nothing more than to be left alone. He spent his days watching the villagers, listening to their terrified whispers, which he mistook for animosity. His heart ached with a longing he didn’t know how to voice. He found solace in solitude and in the patterns of the setting sun, and that was it. Until the music began.

The first time Elara sang, Ignis nearly jolted from his cavern. The sweet melody, so full of life and light, was unlike anything he'd heard in centuries. He poked his head cautiously out of his cave entrance, a large, stony cavern filled with sparkling treasures, to listen. The girl’s voice was so pure, so filled with genuine happiness, that it tugged at something deep inside him.

Every day after that, Elara sang. She sang of friendship and kindness, of the enduring strength of nature and the importance of sharing. Her voice, carried on the wind, wrapped around Ignis, slowly melting the icy wall he had built around his heart.

He started to recognize the tunes, to anticipate the verses. The stories they told began to creep into his dreams, which were no longer filled with only shadow and loss, but with hints of sunlight and open skies.

He wanted to see the girl, to know her, to understand where the beauty of her music came from. But fear, that old, unwelcome friend, held him captive. What would she think of him? What would she say?

One particularly crisp autumn afternoon, Elara sang a song about a lonely dragon, hidden on a mountain, yearning for a friend. The song was incredibly moving and contained all of Elara's passion and genuine kindness. That day, the music felt even closer to him, almost tangible.

He couldn't bear it anymore. As Elara reached the final notes of her song, a single, enormous emerald tear rolled down Ignis's cheek, and splashed onto a nearby rock, leaving behind a tiny, glistening pool. He knew then he had to make himself seen. He had to at least try.

Gathering his courage, he lumbered out of his cave. He descended the mountain, his emerald scales gleaming in the fading sunlight. He knew he couldn't be seen by the villagers, they’d panic, so he picked his way carefully down the mountain and around their homes.

He approached the little hill where Elara usually sang and hid himself behind a thicket of bushes, peeking at her from a concealed vantage point. His huge, scaled body barely fit, and some of his large tail could be seen behind him. Elara, noticing the movement, stopped singing.

She hesitated for a moment. The silence felt heavy in the air. But when Ignis peeked further, he noticed her jaw fell and her eyes grew wide with wonder. No, not fear, which was the one thing Ignis felt as if it was his constant companion for an eternity. It was curiosity. She had never seen a dragon so close up.

Ignis, who had been practising for this very moment for many days, summoned his bravest tone, his voice was a deep rumble, but it held an unexpected tremor. "You… you are the one who sings," he said, each word requiring an effort.

Elara nodded, her own voice a surprised whisper, "Yes. That’s… that's me."

Ignis was surprised at her calm and the total lack of terror.

"Your… your songs are beautiful," he continued. “They… they reach me.” He quickly added “up on the mountain.”

Elara smiled, a smile that reached all the way to her eyes. "Thank you," she said. "I sing because… well, because the world is beautiful, and I want to share that beauty."

He remained quiet. He had done his best to approach and had run out of courage. He suddenly felt self-conscious of his size and his imposing nature.

“Are you… are you the grumpy dragon?” Elara asked.

Ignis deflated. "That is what the villagers call me," he confessed. "But it is not what I want to be. I used to… I used to be happy." He could almost feel his memories closing in on him as soon as he uttered this, but Elara gave him a gentle nod.

He wanted to tell her more. He wanted to express to her how he was so, so, lonely.

"Would you like… to hear another song?" Elara asked, her voice soft and full of kindness.

Ignis’s heart leaped in his chest. He carefully, and slowly, nodded. He wasn't sure his giant body could have held another throb of delight.

Elara began to sing a song about friendship, about the joy of companionship, and of seeing the world anew with someone to share it with. This time, though, the song wasn't just carried on the wind; it floated directly towards Ignis.

As she sang, Ignis felt the last remnants of his isolation crumble away. He saw a way out of his loneliness. He had someone, he now knew, to connect with.

When she finished, he stepped out from behind the bushes. He stood tall and in full view, a shimmering beacon of emerald. His presence was undeniably impressive, but this time, it held no threat. Elara wasn't afraid. Her gaze reflected the warmth that he now started to feel within.

"That was… the best song," Ignis said, his voice filled with a newfound emotion.

"You have a beautiful name," Elara said. “Ignis. It means ‘fire’ in some of the oldest languages. Do you have fire?"

Ignis nodded, but quickly added "But I mostly use it to warm my tea. I had a small mountain of fire-roasted potatoes prepared, too."

He let out a breath of air that was indeed the color of tea smoke and the warmth of a gentle fire.

From that day on, Elara and Ignis became the best of friends. Elara visited him on the mountaintop every day, sharing songs, stories, and laughter. She learned about Ignis’s past, about his lost friends and his aching loneliness. She, in turn, learned to appreciate his gentleness, his kindness, and the immense beauty that resided within his giant, scaled heart.

Ignis discovered that he didn’t need to be a grumpy dragon. He found himself, not alone on the mountain, but sharing meals with a warm companion. With his friend, he saw the beauty in her kindness, her music, the beauty of the sunrise and sunset. And in return, she was no longer worried, with an aching loneliness in her heart. Instead, she began to realize a joy she had never thought existed before.

Elara, in turn, became known throughout the village as the girl who befriended the dragon. The villagers, seeing the change in Ignis, the way the mountaintop was no longer shadowed by darkness but seemed to gleam in the sunshine, slowly began to overcome their fear. They came to visit the mountain, cautiously at first, then with growing enthusiasm, bearing gifts of flowers and cakes.

Ignis welcomed them. He showed them his cavern filled with treasures. He even roasted giant potatoes for them all on occasion, and the mountain air filled with laughter.

And Elara? She continued to sing. Her songs changed, grew deeper, wider, richer with understanding, celebrating the power of friendship, the joy of connection, and the enduring beauty that blossoms even in the most unexpected of places. The village of Oakhaven learned that their perceived fear had become joy, a testament to the power of a single, singing heart, and a friendly dragon who had found his smile again.
