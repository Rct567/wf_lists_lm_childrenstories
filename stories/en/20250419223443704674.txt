<title>The Wise Owl and His Stories of Long, Long Ago Times.</title><body>
Deep within the Whispering Woods, lived a wise old owl named Professor Sophocles. Now, Professor Sophocles wasn't just any owl. Oh no! He wore spectacles perched upon his feathery brow, a tiny graduation cap (slightly askew), and he had a reputation for telling the most fantastically silly stories. Every evening, under the twinkling moonlight, creatures from far and wide would gather beneath the largest oak tree – a tree that was so old, its branches tickled the clouds. There, perched upon a particularly sturdy branch, Professor Sophocles would begin.

Tonight, Barnaby Badger, Penelope Porcupine, and Reginald Rabbit (who was perpetually late) had settled in comfortably. Even Bartholomew Bear, who usually hibernated until winter, was wide awake, his enormous tummy rumbling with anticipation.

Professor Sophocles cleared his throat – a sound like rusty hinges swinging in the wind – and began.

"Gather 'round, my little listeners!" he hooted, adjusting his spectacles. "Tonight's story is a particularly…peculiar one. It concerns the Great Gooey Gobstopper Games of Globule Glades!"

Penelope Porcupine gasped. "Gobstopper Games? With giant gobstoppers?"

Professor Sophocles winked. "Indeed, my dear Penelope! Long, long ago, in a time when trees wore hats and rivers sang opera, lived the residents of Globule Glades. Their primary pastime? The Great Gooey Gobstopper Games! And this year, the competition was fiercer than a grumpy griffin on a Monday morning!"

The audience leaned in closer. Bartholomew Bear licked his lips, imagining a gobstopper the size of his head.

"The first event," Professor Sophocles continued, his voice gaining momentum, "was the Gobstopper-Eating Gallop! Competitors had to eat as many gigantic, gloriously-gooey gobstoppers as they could while running a circular track made entirely of bouncy jelly."

Barnaby Badger chuckled. "Bouncy jelly? That sounds awfully jiggly!"

"Jiggly indeed, Barnaby!" Professor Sophocles agreed. "The champion that year was Gertrude the Goose, who managed to consume seventy-three gobstoppers before collapsing in a fit of giggles! She even bounced all the way to the finish line after her last gobstopper!"

Reginald Rabbit, who had finally arrived (after missing the first few sentences), hopped forward excitedly. "Seventy-three gobstoppers? Goodness gracious! What flavours were they?"

"Ah, an excellent question, Reginald!" Professor Sophocles replied. "They were a vibrant medley, my friend! Flavours like: 'Burnt Toast Tango', 'Soggy Sock Surprise', and my personal favourite, 'Unicorn Hiccup Happiness'!"

The crowd gasped.

"The second event," the owl announced, "was the Gobstopper-Tossing Tournament! Competitors had to hurl these sugary spheres across the Whispering Waterfall, aiming for a giant, groaning grumpy goldfish called Gordon."

"Gordon the Goldfish?" Penelope exclaimed. "Groaning? Why was he groaning?"

Professor Sophocles stroked his feathery chin. "Because, my dear Penelope, Gordon had a rather sensitive tummy. Any errant gobstopper that landed on his scales would cause him to let out a most mournful moan."

Barnaby, being rather fond of fish, worried his brow.

"The winner of the Gobstopper-Tossing Tournament was Bartholomew Bumble, a bumblebee of exceptional strength, who threw his gobstopper so far, it actually reached the moon and it gave the moon a Gobstopper-Shaped toothache!"

Bartholomew Bear blushed with pride. "Goodness, me!"

"And finally," Professor Sophocles announced with a flourish, "the grand finale: The Gobstopper-Sculpting Spectacular! Competitors had to sculpt a work of art from the Gobstoppers before they, well… melted into a sugary goo! This required patience, precision, and a very fast hand! Or perhaps the usage of a freezing ray if a contestant wanted to be clever!"

Reginald Rabbit wiggled his nose. "What did they make? What sculptures?"

"They made wonders, my dear Reginald! Professor Piffle, a penguin with a penchant for poetry, crafted a magnificent monument to mushy peas. Esmerelda the Elephant, surprisingly artistic, sculpted a splendid statue of a sweating snail. And Barnaby Badger's great-grandpappy carved a gobstopper-shaped garden gnome with a very angry look!"

Barnaby badger smiled proudly.

The evening wore on, and as the Professor finished telling of the Gobstopper-Sculpting Spectacular and the winner which was none other than the Mayor of Globule Glades himself (whose masterpiece was a melting self-portrait!), Reginald Rabbit suddenly yawned.

“Oh, dear,” he said. “I'm frightfully sleepy.”

Barnaby, Penelope, and Bartholomew agreed. Even Bartholomew Bear’s tummy had quietened. They were feeling satisfied and also tired after listening to the strange tale from the Wise Owl.

Professor Sophocles peered at them through his spectacles. "Ah, yes," he hooted gently. "Bedtime beckons, does it not? But before you drift off into the land of nod, let me tell you one final, very important lesson that I hope will stay with you." He paused. "Always remember that the best gobstopper flavor is… the flavor of friendship! Because you will always have your friends! Especially if you are sharing a giant gobstopper."

The creatures mumbled sleepy agreements. They then took themselves home. Barnaby went to bed with a grin on his face, dreaming of bouncy jelly tracks. Penelope, nestled amongst her quills, imagined giant gobstopper-shaped garden gnomes. Bartholomew, thankfully, made a beeline for hibernation. Even Reginald Rabbit eventually fell asleep and had an incredible dream. He dreamt of the Gobstopper-Eating Gallop, and, oddly enough, did not miss the finish line!

Professor Sophocles watched them go, a twinkle in his eye. He understood that to be a wise owl was to tell silly stories; silly stories filled with imagination and a healthy dose of nonsense. They were not always what he originally wrote to tell. But the core of his wisdom would always remain in all of his stories, and with that, Professor Sophocles closed his eyes, rested his feathery head upon his branch and slipped off to dream himself, probably of… giant gobstoppers. And he then knew that tomorrow evening, under the twinkling moonlight, the adventure of the Whispering Woods could be re-told and would start again!
