<title>The Elephant's Extraordinary Memory</title><body>Once upon a time, nestled in the heart of the African savanna, lived a young elephant named Elara. Elara wasn't just any elephant; she possessed an extraordinary memory. She could remember the smallest details, from the rustle of the acacia leaves in the wind to the chirping of the tiny weaver birds building their nests.

Elara spent her days exploring the vast savanna with her mother, Esme, and the other members of her herd. They would stroll through tall, golden grasses, cool off in the muddy waterholes, and feast on sweet, juicy fruits. Every day was an adventure, and Elara, with her remarkable memory, soaked up every single moment.

One sunny morning, while the herd was enjoying a leisurely breakfast of baobab leaves, a mischievous baboon named Boko swung down from a nearby tree. Boko was known for his tricks and playful nature. He loved to tease the other animals, especially the younger ones, by hiding their favorite things.

Boko spotted Elara happily munching on her leaves and saw an opportunity for a bit of fun. “Hello, little one!” Boko chattered, his eyes twinkling with mischief. "Did you know that delicious fruit grows just over the hills? But I know a secret path to get there. However, you need a small token to be allowed on that path."

Elara, ever curious, looked up. "A token?" she asked, her big, floppy ears perked up.

"Yes! A small, shiny pebble. One is enough, otherwise it would be to heavy" Boko replied with a grin. "Find it quickly, because these fruits only grow while the sun shines." And with a final cheeky grin, Boko scampered off toward the towering baobab trees.

Elara’s trunk twitched in excitement. A secret path to even tastier fruit? She couldn't wait to discover it!

Esme, her mother, noticed Elara’s excitement. “What’s this about a special path, little one?” she asked gently.

“Boko said there’s a secret path to delicious fruit, but I need a shiny pebble!” Elara exclaimed.

Esme chuckled, “Be careful with Boko, dear. He loves to play tricks.”

Undeterred, Elara began her search. She carefully scanned the ground, using her trunk to investigate every stone and pebble. She remembered every little detail from her morning stroll. She remembered seeing some pebbles sparkling in the sunlight near the waterhole, then the ones on the other side near the rocky cliff.

Remembering every detail of the environment allowed her to recall that shiny stones only shone from the sunlight. If she looked in the opposite of the shade she wouldn't have had a good time!

Finally, Elara found it! Near the base of a large acacia tree, she spotted a perfectly round, shimmering pebble. It was just the right size for her little trunk. With a satisfied trumpeting sound, she carefully picked up the pebble and hurried off towards the hills where Boko had gone.

As she walked, Elara continued to use her amazing memory. She recalled the direction in which Boko disappeared. She was able to locate him on his path.

When she arrived at the bottom of the hills, Elara looked all around. She didn't spot Boko.
Instead, a wise old tortoise, with a shell weathered by time, was patiently observing the landscape.

"Excuse me, Mr. Tortoise," Elara said politely, "Have you seen a baboon named Boko? He told me about a secret path to the delicious fruit, but I haven't been able to find him yet. "

The tortoise blinked slowly. "Ah, young Elara," he rumbled, his voice deep and resonant. "Boko? Always up to his tricks. He likes to make the other animals believe he's the smartest on the savanna. Don't worry, I've observed a lot of things here; the sun, the trees, and how Boko went up. He went that way."

Mr. Tortoise pointed his ancient wrinkled face toward a hidden path which was now filled with baboons eating what seemed to be the most amazing fruits.

“Just be wary.” Mr. Tortoise reminded her. “The way Boko went leads to a lot of baboons in a closed area.”

Elara, thanking Mr. Tortoise, was now on her way to Boko. Her extraordinary memory helped her find a very convenient path to the place. As she climbed, the sweet scent of fruit grew stronger. She passed many other animals, all going towards the area where Boko disappeared. But Elara knew she couldn't let go the stone!
She must be polite, she thought. She has to give the pebble as told by Boko.

Finally, she reached the entrance of a small cave-like area hidden behind a cluster of prickly bushes. And there was Boko, surrounded by all kinds of fruit. He seemed to be enjoying himself with all of the other baboons, ignoring the surrounding situation. Elara knew that baboons love fruits. She noticed the scene that was unfolding before her very eyes.

Elara, despite her young age, did not know what to think!
Boko was now surrounded by all those fruits, he wasn't aware she had arrived.

"Hello, Boko!" Elara called out cheerfully.

Boko spun around, his eyes widening in surprise. "Elara! You found it? Good, very good!" he exclaimed, a slightly mischievous glint still in his eyes.

"Here's the token," Elara said, holding out the shiny pebble with her trunk.

Boko took the pebble, examined it for a second, then burst out laughing. "Yes, very shiny!" he hooted. "Alright! Now come and have your fruit!"

Elara entered the cave, and began to eat! Then, Boko turned around. He asked Elara for her own impression about all the gathered fruits.

As Elara took her first bite of a juicy red fruit, she noticed something strange. The cave was filled with hundreds of baboons! But instead of simply eating, they were also fighting. The other baboons were trying to grab as many fruits as possible, they would steal it, they would eat on other's. They started throwing fruits one another.
A chaotic fight took place between baboons over fruits. Elara was a bit scared, seeing so many baboons fighting!

"Boko," Elara said, puzzled. "What's going on here?"

Boko shrugged, clearly enjoying the chaos. "Oh, nothing much. Just a game, you see? Every year we get the juiciest fruit from this place. But to be allowed, the baboons should take and share as much as they can with their family. These fruits should be shared with those who are hungry."

Suddenly, Elara's amazing memory came into play. She remembered what Mr. Tortoise had told her, the need to be wary about the number of baboons present.
"Sharing?" Elara inquired.

"That's right! Share your fruits," Boko emphasized. "These are for my baboons!"

Elara looked around and realized the real intent.
In fact, it was only Boko that would eat and share the fruits to his baboon family.

Then, Elara's amazing memory helped her realize something else.
Boko wasn't sharing his fruit, the others were.
The baboons weren't happy. They would keep everything to themselves, eating and destroying things that were left on their ways.
Boko, by his words, was trying to be selfish and keep all fruits to himself and his group.

Quickly, Elara saw through Boko's scheme. Boko had been using the shiny pebble as an excuse. This area was probably filled with baboons as to control their hunger and create a false paradise.

Suddenly, Elara remembered the location of all the fruit trees that she, and her herd had visited on her travels. They were located at various distances. Most of the trees were empty because everyone has taken fruits as Boko ordered.

Elara trumpeted loudly. "Boko, stop this game! These fruits aren't yours. You told me this path belongs to fruits, the others must eat as you have. Mr. Tortoise told me a lesson about it. Don't lie, all fruits must be shared by everyone, so this would be their share. We could bring to others."

Boko was very impressed at Elara's words and knew he was defeated. "I... I don't..." Boko tried to respond, unable to find words.

Elara continued, using her remarkable memory. "I remember all the other fruit trees! They are full. Some are full of this red juicy fruit you eat now. I can also go help the other animals."

Elara turned to the other baboons. "You don't need to fight!" she called out. "Come with me. We can all go to different places and get fruit, if all of you help me.”

The other baboons, tired of fighting, paused and looked at Elara, surprised.

Elara, using her incredible memory, lead the way. She remembered all the fruit tree locations. Elara went ahead with other animals who wished to eat delicious fruit from those fruit trees. She explained that by taking everyone with her, everyone was sharing and not trying to take more.

At the start, the Baboons were wary. But Elara showed the example. First by simply taking fruits, as they would regularly do. But now, there were animals, fruits, and harmony in that part of the world. She did it one place at the time. The chaos disappeared and all the baboons felt thankful to her!

With Elara leading the way, they went in an orderly manner, with a group of baboons following her lead. As they moved from tree to tree, the fighting baboons were transformed into helpful beings. They had fruits! They were satisfied. They were all happy.

They came across giraffes and zebras in need of fruits. And helped them. She gathered them as a team.

Soon, the news of Elara's generosity and the fruits she discovered spread throughout the savanna. Every animal benefited, learning from her kindness.

Elara’s exceptional memory had not only helped her find the fruit, but it had also helped to build a stronger, more supportive community on the savanna. She wasn't only using memory. She used it with sharing.

Boko, realizing the error of his ways, eventually joined in, helping others.

From that day on, the savanna was filled with harmony and shared kindness. Elara and her herd, along with all the other animals, would always remember the day the little elephant with the extraordinary memory had brought them together, changing the way they saw the world and made everyone happy. Elara often visited Mr. Tortoise to learn more about her abilities. The savanna was the proof that a bit of smartness, kindfulness and extraordinary memory may result into the greatest of changes.
And Elara, the elephant with the extraordinary memory, continued to explore the savanna, helping others and creating the best possible moments with those who she loves!
And that's the end of this beautiful story.</body>
