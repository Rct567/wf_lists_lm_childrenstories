<title>The Absent-Minded Ant's Anthem</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in the whispering meadows of Meadowsweet Valley, lived a tiny ant named Alfie. Now, Alfie wasn’t just any ant. He was, quite possibly, the most absent-minded ant in the entire anthill. He was so lost in his own thoughts, dreaming of faraway lands and singing little songs to himself, that he often forgot where he was, what he was doing, or even what his own name was!

Alfie was a cheerful little fellow, though. His constant forgetfulness didn't dampen his spirits one bit. In fact, it made him even more endearing to his fellow ants, who were, let's just say, a little more organized.

One sunny morning, the Queen Ant, a stern but fair matriarch, summoned all the ants to a very important meeting. A particularly juicy crumb of blueberry pie, a prize of epic proportions, had been spotted near the edge of the Whispering Woods. The ants, as a colony, were to retrieve it!

“Attention, my loyal subjects!” the Queen Ant boomed, her antennae twitching with anticipation. “We shall embark on a grand expedition! Our mission: to retrieve the magnificent blueberry crumb! Remember the plan! One scout ahead, two carrying parties, and a rearguard to defend against any stray grasshoppers! Understood?”

A chorus of tiny “Yes, Your Majesty!” filled the air.

Alfie, however, was gazing at a particularly intriguing cloud shaped like a giant strawberry. “Oh, wouldn't it be lovely to visit a strawberry cloud one day?” he murmured to himself, completely oblivious to the Queen's announcement. He was so engrossed that he nearly bumped into a very important carrier ant named Beatrice.

“Alfie! Are you even listening?” Beatrice snapped, her mandibles clicking with exasperation. “The crumb! The mission!”

Alfie blinked, startled. “The…crumble…mission? Oh! Right! Sounds…crumby!” He giggled, then promptly forgot what they were talking about.

The expedition began. A scout ant, a swift and nimble fellow named Zoom, sped ahead. Two carrying parties, each comprised of four strong ants, were assigned to the crumb. The rearguard, tasked with protecting the others, consisted of the toughest ants in the colony. And Alfie? Well, Alfie was supposed to be with one of the carrying parties. He had been assigned a very specific task: to sing motivational songs to keep the spirits up! The Queen had deemed his constant humming a “peculiarly calming” effect, despite her often grumbling.

As the carrying parties started on their trek, Alfie lagged behind, humming a tuneless melody. He was looking at a butterfly, its wings a dazzling array of colours. “Such pretty patterns,” he mused, "I wonder if those patterns are a map?"

Suddenly, he heard a frantic cry. It was from Zoom! Zoom, the scout, had run into trouble. He had stumbled upon a group of greedy beetles, who were also eyeing the delicious blueberry crumb!

"Help! Help!" Zoom cried. "They're trying to steal it!"

The rearguard ants, led by the gruff but brave Commander Buzz, charged forward to defend their prize. But the beetles were bigger, stronger, and there were more of them! It was a real ant-beetle standoff.

Alfie, still wandering behind, humming, finally realized something was wrong. He spotted the commotion and his eyes widened. He knew he had to do something, and even if he didn't fully understand what was going on, he knew it involved the crumb, the carrying parties, and some rather nasty beetles. He had a sudden urge to...sing.

He cleared his throat. He imagined he was on a stage with all eyes on him. He took a deep breath and began. What came out wasn't the simple tuneless hum he usually mumbled. This time, it was an actual song. A song about blueberry pie and the importance of working together!

“Oh, blueberry crumb, so sweet and grand,
The tastiest treat in all the land!
We ants will fight, we ants will strive,
To keep our prize and stay alive!
Beetles, beware, your greed won't win,
This crumb is ours, from outside and in!
For teamwork strong, and hearts so bold,
A tasty tale, will soon be told!”

His voice, although small, was surprisingly clear. And because of his unique habit of talking to himself in rhyming prose, the words held a strangely captivating power! The rearguard ants, surprised by the unexpected serenade, found their determination renewed. The beetle's attention turned away from the crumb and toward this curious spectacle. They paused.

"What is... that noise?" the biggest beetle, Bartholomew, grumbled. "A singing ant? Pathetic!"

But the song continued, spreading to the front carriers who were just at a standstill from a sense of looming threat.

“With tiny legs and hearts so true,
We'll pull that crumb, me and you!
Through grass and stem, and earth so deep,
Our crumb we'll haul, while others sleep!
So join the line, and lift your weight,
For crumb of joy, before it's late!
Let's keep our minds upon the aim,
And grab that crumb, and all its fame!"

The rearguard ants, galvanized by the anthem, fought with even more ferocity. Commander Buzz charged with a newfound energy. The beetle began to hesitate, bewildered by this sudden burst of antish enthusiasm. They realised that singing ant was also quite distracting. Some turned away, completely overwhelmed.

"Ugh, it's catching on." said Bartholomew. The bigger beetles looked at each other, realizing that if more ants began singing and picking up enthusiasm, their hopes would die and they might suffer in the bargain. 

The carrying party, inspired by Alfie's song, put their shoulders to the crumb, and began to pull. Then the second carrying party started in time. They were beginning to be drawn in the song as well. Alfie continued his anthem, his little voice gaining confidence, the beat resonating and the rhythm pulling everyone along with a cheerful step.

“The crumb is here, the crumb is near,
Let’s vanquish fear, and conquer clear!
The hungry stomachs, a tasty need,
A crumb of pleasure, indeed indeed!
So on we march, with joyful hearts,
Dividing burdens, playing all our parts!
Until at last, the mission done,
A crumb of blueberry, well and won!”

The beetles, confused and defeated, retreated. The rearguard cheered, a triumphant yell echoing through the meadow. The ants of the carrying parties pulled their crumb over a fallen leaf and they got closer to victory. The scout zoomed. Alfie had done his best work.

With the beetles gone, and with their spirits soaring, the ants marched towards their home.

The song, born of Alfie's absent-mindedness and the most accidental plan to give meaning to what he sang, the most unlikely weapon against the most unpleasant foe, and had a unifying effect upon the colony that only an anthemic quality to the most silly situation ever written, to do justice.

The crumb was saved!

Back at the anthill, the Queen Ant, usually very stoic and solemn, surprised everyone by giving Alfie a rare smile. "Well sung, Alfie," she declared, "You saved the day!"

Alfie blinked. "I… I did?" He looked around, bewildered. “Did I… miss breakfast?”

He wasn't exactly sure what had happened, or even if he had actually sung. All he remembered were the colours of the strawberry cloud and the general sentiment of pie-related goodness. But everyone agreed he had definitely played his part!

From that day on, Alfie, the absent-minded ant, became the colony's official Anthem Singer. Whenever a difficult task loomed, or a dangerous situation arose, Alfie was there to sing. And his anthems, though often quirky and nonsensical, never failed to lift the spirits of the ants and inspire them to work together. The words came straight from his heart.

The anthill became a little bit brighter. Little ants would march through the halls with pep, often imitating the tunes Alfie had been making, some remembering it, even if briefly, until it came time for their day to settle into routines of chores. Commander Buzz may also sing, but that may be just a rumour to get everyone going at morning. The anthill became a musical palace. Even Beatrice started to smile more!

Sometimes, Alfie would forget to eat, or where he was going, but nobody would remind him. It did not matter to them; the anthem had done its work. He'd find himself looking at things that no ant would ever look at, dreaming dreams that no ant could ever imagine, all the while, continuing to sing.

And so, Alfie the Absent-Minded Ant, the forgetful composer, became a hero, reminding everyone that even the most distracted individuals could play a vital role, and that sometimes, the most unlikely things can bring a colony, or a child, together with a happy and lasting impact. The power of song. The Anthem. The End.
