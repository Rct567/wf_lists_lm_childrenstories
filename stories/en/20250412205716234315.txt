<title>The Time the Moon Borrowed the Sun’s Glasses</title>
<body>
Barnaby Button was a boy whose eyebrows were permanently surprised. Not because he was surprised, but because they were bushy and stubbornly pointed upwards, giving him the perpetual air of astonishment. Barnaby lived in a house shaped like a giant teapot, situated on a hill overlooking the silliest village in the whole world: Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth.

Now, in Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth, peculiar things happened with astonishing regularity. For example, the postman, Mr. Grumbles, delivered letters riding a unicycle whilst whistling opera. The baker, Mrs. Plum, baked pies filled with giggle-inducing jelly beans instead of fruit, which caused uncontrollable fits of the giggles in anyone who dared to eat them. And the town clock chimed not with hours and minutes, but with rhyming couplets, often about squirrels wearing tiny top hats.

One particularly peculiar Tuesday, however, eclipsed all previous peculiar events. That Tuesday, the Moon, a celestial body usually seen in the inky blackness of the night sky, decided to borrow the Sun’s spectacles.

The Sun, you see, wasn't just any sun. He was a particularly nearsighted sun. He had a magnificent pair of spectacles, round and gold-rimmed, which he needed to see properly. Without his spectacles, the Sun could barely distinguish between a fluffy cloud and a gigantic custard pie floating in the sky. He was also rather vain and enjoyed showing off his shiny spectacles, but mostly needed them for the important business of radiating warmth and light.

The Moon, on the other hand, had perfect vision. Perfectly normal moon vision, that is. But she was incredibly bored. Floating in the darkness, all she had to look at were the twinkling stars, which, frankly, could get rather repetitive. One day, peering over the shoulder of a passing space cloud, she saw the Sun, perched in the sky, his golden spectacles gleaming.

“Ooh,” the Moon hooted, (for she was a very excitable moon), “those spectacles are rather fetching!”

The Sun, preening his fiery mane, overheard and, being rather sociable, beckoned the Moon closer. “Why, thank you, Moon. I’m quite fond of them myself. Can’t see a thing without them, you know. Makes cloud-watching rather difficult, as you can imagine.”

The Moon, captivated, decided there and then she needed a pair of spectacles of her very own. “Oh, Sun, do you think I could… could I possibly borrow your spectacles, just for a little while? I’d love to see what the world looks like through them!”

The Sun, a bit flustered by the audacity of it all (he’d never lent his spectacles to anyone before), mumbled something about needing them to keep shining brightly. But the Moon, being persuasive and sparkling rather enchantingly in the sky, insisted. Finally, overcome by her sheer lunar persistence, the Sun relented. He carefully removed his golden spectacles and, with a wink of his own solar eye (which he couldn't see properly, of course, without his glasses), handed them over.

“Just be careful with them, Moon,” he warned. “They’re quite important, you know. Don’t drop them! Or smudge them! And whatever you do, don’t… eat them.” (He'd heard a rumour the Moon had a particularly strong craving for shiny things.)

The Moon, bubbling with glee, gently perched the golden spectacles on her face. They were a little bit too big, and kept sliding down her silvery nose. The world instantly blurred. Everything became a fuzzy, colourful, wonderful mess. Barnaby Button's surprised eyebrows reached new heights of astonishment. The clock in Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth chimed:

*“The Moon, a glitzy spectacle thief,*
*Has blurred all views, to cause belief*
*The world’s a watercolour splash,*
*And now the Sun must surely flash!*”

Barnaby Button, alerted by the chiming rhyme, rushed out of his teapot-shaped house. He looked up and saw the Moon, with her blurry view. He realised something very, very wrong was going on. "Goodness gracious me," Barnaby stammered (his surprised eyebrows almost fell off with shock), "the Sun's spectacles! The Moon has them! Everything’s blurry!"

Chaos ensued in Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth. The jelly bean pies, lacking the guidance of proper light, began to wobble and dissolve mid-air, splattering giggles across the entire village. Mr. Grumbles, unable to see the road ahead, cycled straight into a giant pile of bouncy castles, the opera whistle replaced by a squeaking noise. Mrs. Plum’s baking skills seemed to have gone out the window; the baker, in her blurred world, was accidentally baking hats filled with custard.

Meanwhile, the Moon was having a wonderfully silly time. She could now see the world through a completely different lens: the lens of a near-sighted sun! She saw the fluffy clouds as giant, delicious marshmallows, the stars as twinkling confetti, and the Earth as one enormous, wobbling jelly bean (which, unfortunately for her, was strictly off-limits). She floated in this hazy wonderland, happily bouncing about.

But as time wore on, the situation became rather problematic. Without his spectacles, the Sun found it almost impossible to shine. The world grew noticeably dimmer. The flowers began to droop. The giggle-inducing jelly beans lost their giggling power. The squirrels wearing tiny top hats started to look incredibly despondent, since no one could see them.

Barnaby, observing all this, knew something had to be done. He, despite his perpetual surprise, possessed a rather sharp mind (he had to be able to work out how his teapot functioned, after all!). He realised the key lay with the Moon, and so, equipped with a gigantic, sparkly magnifying glass (borrowed from the village inventor, Professor Phileas Piffle), Barnaby began his climb into the night sky.

This wasn't easy, of course. The sky, usually just an airy expanse, was now rather bumpy and full of the same fuzzy shapes the moon was seeing through the spectacles. After a while of scaling a giant cloud which tasted like over-cooked spinach, Barnaby clambered atop a giant helium balloon shaped like a strawberry. Using the sparkly magnifying glass, Barnaby Button began to create a beam of light to try and highlight the sun. He used the reflected sunshine in the magnifying glass to project his picture of how good the Sun’s glasses are for him and shine back down to the moon!

As the amplified sunlight beamed toward the Moon, it finally became apparent to the silly celestial orb just how her decision had backfired, after all. The Sun was missing, everything was less bright, and the world was going a bit gloomy. Her borrowed spectacles were the issue.

As she peered at the beam, the spectacles momentarily slipped down her nose. Barnaby seized his opportunity. He carefully leaped from the giant strawberry balloon (landing, thankfully, on a soft, marshmallow cloud) and grabbed a giant, brightly coloured skipping rope, tying one end to the Moon's fluffy, cloud-like cheek. Then, Barnaby gave the rope a gentle tug.

"Excuse me, Moon!" he shouted, his voice carrying across the blurry sky. "It seems the world, and most importantly, the Sun, are in a bit of a fix. Could you maybe return those spectacles? They really are essential for his work! Otherwise we will have to eat a never-ending supply of broccoli." (Barnaby’s voice had extra volume, as the mention of vegetables had triggered the fear.)

The Moon, looking at the gloom below, and imagining a world of endless broccoli, realised the error of her ways. With a sigh, she gently removed the golden spectacles. Everything snapped back into focus. The world, the trees, the grass, the bouncy castles and the giggle-inducing pies became sharp and clear once more.

The Sun, now able to see again, burst forth with all his usual brilliance, cheering up the flowers, the giggling jelly beans and all the little squirrels and people with the top hats.

The Moon, rather shamefaced, apologised profusely. She realised that borrowing was only fun when done wisely. She gave the golden spectacles back to the sun, promised never to make the world blurry again and returned to her rightful place in the night sky, albeit with a slightly wistful look.

The clock in Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth chimed again, this time in joyous relief:

*“The Sun’s glasses, safe and sound,*
*The blur has faded from the ground,*
*The Moon learned to play fair this day,*
*And all is normal, hip hooray!”*

Barnaby Button, his eyebrows finally beginning to relax ever so slightly, returned to his teapot-shaped house. The world, and most importantly the giggles, were back in full swing. The next day, Barnaby, seeing the happy face of Mr. Grumbles, had an incredible idea. He gave the postman a giant, colourful scarf which also had tiny telescopes and encouraged the opera-loving Mr. Grumbles to only use it. Giggleswick-on-the-Mirth continued to be the silliest, and the most enjoyable, place in the whole world. And though no one, not even Barnaby's eyebrows, ever quite forgot the time the Moon borrowed the Sun’s glasses, they could, thankfully, look forward to a very normal, brightly lit future.
