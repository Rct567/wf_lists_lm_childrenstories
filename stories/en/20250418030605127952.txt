<title>Solving Mysteries with Super Powered Friends</title><body>
Barnaby Buttonsworth lived in a house that was, to put it mildly, peculiar. Not because it was haunted, or built of gingerbread (though that wouldn't have been entirely unwelcome), but because his neighbours were all… well, super. Not "super nice" super, but actual, bona fide, able-to-leap-tall-buildings-in-a-single-bound super.

There was Brenda Bolt, who could run faster than a greased sausage down a hill. Her superpower was so fast, she often bumped into lampposts and confused pigeons. Then there was Gregory Gigglebottom, who could inflate like a balloon with a single, loud "Giggle!" He was particularly susceptible to tickling, which would cause him to bounce around the garden like an overgrown beach ball. And finally, there was Penelope Ponder, who had the incredible power of… wait for it… being incredibly good at puzzles. Not as exciting as super-speed or inflation, perhaps, but surprisingly useful.

Barnaby, being a regular boy (albeit one with a rather unfortunate tendency to lose his shoes), was a little envious of his super-powered friends. He longed to be able to fly, or shoot laser beams from his eyeballs, or at least be able to open a particularly stubborn jar of jam. Alas, his only real talent was for getting into scrapes.

One Tuesday, while Barnaby was attempting to eat his toast whilst juggling three rubber chickens (don't ask), a frantic rapping echoed through his wonky, wonky front door. It was Mrs. Higgins, a portly woman with a penchant for bright floral hats and a tendency to overreact.

"Oh, Barnaby!" she wailed, waving a limp hanky. "My prize-winning petunia, Princess Petal, has… has… disappeared!"

Princess Petal was a magnificent, purple petunia, the pride and joy of Mrs. Higgins's prize-winning garden. She had won the "Most Magnificent Petunia" award for three years running. Her disappearance was a serious matter.

Barnaby, still trying to wrangle his toast, peered out the door. Mrs. Higgins was a mess. Her floral hat was askew, and tears were streaming down her face, mingling with her mascara and turning her cheeks a dramatic shade of purple (matching Princess Petal, naturally).

"Don't worry, Mrs. Higgins!" Barnaby declared, momentarily forgetting the rubber chickens. "We'll find her!"

He knew just who to call.

First, he summoned Brenda Bolt. Brenda arrived in a blur, leaving a trail of fallen leaves and a bewildered squirrel in her wake. She'd bumped into a dustbin on her way, judging by the unfortunate smear of something resembling yesterday's fish and chips across her cheek.

"Princess Petal! Gone?" Brenda yelped, before tripping over a particularly stubborn paving stone.

Next, Barnaby beeped Gregory Gigglebottom on his super-secret, extra-loud, snail-shaped mobile phone (a gift from Brenda – it was supposed to be faster, but Gregory usually ended up giggling too much to press the buttons properly). After a few giggles and a lot of explaining (it was a bit hard to explain "stolen flower" to someone who only communicated in giggles), Gregory inflated and bounced his way over, looking a bit like a purple, inflatable dumpling.

Finally, he called Penelope Ponder. Penelope, as always, was calm and collected, meticulously sharpening a very tiny pencil with a very, very small pencil sharpener. She didn't rush; she simply planned.

"Right," Penelope announced, her voice as steady as a rock. "We need a plan."

And so the "Super-Powered Friends Mystery-Solving Team" was formed.

Their first task was to interview Mrs. Higgins, a tricky task as her tear-stained face was constantly fluctuating with emotion. Brenda, still recovering from her dustbin encounter, volunteered to comfort Mrs. Higgins by offering her a plate of slightly burnt toast. Gregory, giggling nervously, accidentally sat on Mrs. Higgins’ garden gnome, shattering it into several rather decorative pieces.

Meanwhile, Penelope began her investigation. She meticulously examined the evidence: a missing petunia and a very distressed Mrs. Higgins.

"We need clues!" Barnaby declared, feeling very important.

Penelope nodded. "Exactly. Let’s start with the obvious. Is there any sign of a struggle?"

They searched the garden. There was a slight indentation in the earth where Princess Petal had stood, a few scattered petals, and a tiny, sparkly trail.

"Ooh, sparkly!" Brenda shrieked, abandoning her efforts to soothe Mrs. Higgins. "Like… like a glitter bomb exploded!"

Gregory, unfortunately, was too distracted by the gnome's shattered remains to be much help.

Penelope, however, crouched down, her brow furrowed in concentration. She gathered a few of the sparkly bits and examined them.

"Interesting," she murmured. "These aren't just glitter. They’re… miniature… breadcrumbs?"

"Breadcrumbs?" Barnaby echoed, utterly baffled.

"Yes," Penelope confirmed. "And very… strategically placed. Look!"

She pointed to the path, where the tiny breadcrumbs continued in a neat little line, disappearing towards the garden gate.

Brenda, eyes gleaming with sudden understanding, exclaimed, "The squirrels! They're after the petunia!"

Gregory, in a moment of surprising clarity (or perhaps fueled by the memory of his own last sandwich), stopped giggling and pointed towards a particularly fluffy squirrel with a suspiciously smug expression.

"Squirrel!" he declared, giggling in the middle of his pronouncement.

Barnaby, realising the implication, gasped. Squirrels! Of course! He knew those cheeky critters were always after his peanut butter sandwiches. Perhaps they were after Princess Petal too, drawn by the scent of something… flowery?

Their investigation became a wild goose chase across the neighbourhood, propelled by Brenda’s super speed. They followed the trail of breadcrumbs, which lead them to Mrs. Gable’s allotment where they encountered a large fluffy squirrel that looked suspiciously smug and had traces of purple petals in its mouth.
“Squirrel!” repeated Gregory, with even more confidence than before, as the squirrel was attempting to hide, its loot, the magnificent petunia in a hole under a very, very big cabbage leaf.
Brenda sped in after the squirrel and attempted to stop it, but it scurried away. Brenda’s over exuberance resulted in her accidentally speeding into a giant turnip, creating a vortex in the earth and creating a very large hole in the cabbage leaf.

Penelope Ponder stood back and calmly looked on at this chaos. After everyone had calmed down a little and Mrs. Higgins arrived to retrieve her prized petunia, with tears of joy in her eyes, Penelope calmly deduced, that it wasn’t the one smug squirrel.
She pointed towards another slightly smaller and shy-looking squirrel who stood near the vegetable patch with the remnants of petals around it’s mouth.
“Hmm” announced Penelope, calmly.

Barnaby was ecstatic to deduce the conclusion. It was now the Super Powered Friends’ task to rescue Princess Petal from the cage.
The task had taken a turn and needed all the group's cooperation. With Brenda's super-speed and the use of the vortex that was the turnip hole. Barnaby’s shoe mishap caused Brenda to stop still. Penelope, despite being perplexed decided to take matters into her own hands. The challenge involved distracting the cage, finding a method for opening the cage and retrieving the precious prize before the owner’s arrival. Penelope looked on towards Brenda who was currently flustered. She decided to find another way.

“Penelope, any ideas?” Barnaby asked.

Penelope calmly stood there with all eyes on her and paused.

Penelope quietly mentioned that she wanted to start at the end and so started explaining the story backward. She proceeded to give each super friend the appropriate action, after the action she gave them her thoughts. 
“First of all, Brenda must run around Mrs Higgins, whilst I open the door,” she stated.
Brenda did as she was told, with such precision it was so fast, she barely made it.

“Hmm” commented Penelope, with her thoughts.
Next it was time for Barnaby, and she said that it was up to him to grab the door and use that opportunity for stealth. She also added a very important ingredient for the mission; The scent of a peanut butter sandwich to confuse the cage, but be careful. 
As expected, the peanut butter was irresistible, Barnaby used this opportunity to act as the distraction, and Penelope Ponder used the opportunity to grab Princess Petal.

“Hmm” Penelope commented, calmly, after it all went smoothly.
Barnaby, still confused, stood there, his shoeless feet twitching in anticipation of more exciting actions, whilst Penelope added that their last chance of success lay in Gregory's giggling that would give them the chance of escape. This final effort was indeed, successful.
“A magnificent effort from the Super Powered friends mystery solving team”, shouted Mrs. Higgins.

It turned out that the mischievous squirrel, in the hole under the giant cabbage, was not the thief! It had merely been helping. The real culprit was a different, even more cunning squirrel with a weakness for purple flowers. This squirrel, it transpired, had not wanted to eat the flower; it was planning on wearing it.

The end!
