<title>Olivia and Her Amazing Pet Dragon Who Loved to Play Games.</title><body>
“Mama, Papa, look! I got a pet dragon!” Olivia exclaimed, her voice brimming with excitement as she rushed into the kitchen, a small, scaly creature wiggling in her arms.

Her parents, both engrossed in their morning routines, blinked in surprise.

“A dragon, Olivia? Where on earth did you find a dragon?” her mother asked, peering over her spectacles.

Olivia grinned, “He hatched from a sparkly egg I found in the Whispering Woods! He’s very small, and his name is Sparky!” She held Sparky up for them to see. He was indeed small, no bigger than a kitten, with vibrant emerald scales, tiny horns, and big, curious golden eyes.

Her father, a man who usually preferred order and routine, chuckled. “Well, he certainly is… unique. What does a dragon eat, Olivia?”

Olivia thought for a moment. “He seems to like berries! And sunshine! He spends a lot of time soaking up the sunbeams on the windowsill.”

“Berries and sunshine, eh? Sounds easy enough to manage,” her mother said, smiling. “But what does Sparky *do* all day?”

“He loves to play games!” Olivia chirped. “He’s always up for a game of hide-and-seek. He's not very good, though. He always hides behind the curtains!”

The next few days were filled with laughter and playful chaos. Olivia and Sparky became inseparable. They played games morning, noon, and night.

“Ready to play hide-and-seek, Sparky?” Olivia would ask, crouching down.

Sparky, with a delighted chirp, would zoom off, often heading directly for the living room curtains. Olivia would pretend to search, peeking behind the couch and under tables.

“Where could he be?” she'd whisper dramatically. “Hmmm… I wonder…” Then she’d approach the curtains. “Aha! I knew it!” She'd pull back the curtains to reveal Sparky, giggling, or rather, making dragon-like chirps.

One sunny afternoon, they were playing in the garden.

“Let’s play tag, Sparky!” Olivia suggested.

Sparky, who was perched on a sun-drenched rock, puffed out a small cloud of smoke and gave a happy nod.

“Alright, you’re it!” Olivia declared, and she playfully tagged him.

Sparky, however, wasn't very fast. He’d try to fly, but his wings were still small and fluttery. He'd flap his little wings frantically, taking only a few hops into the air before gently landing again. Olivia would run around the garden, giggling, with Sparky attempting to chase her.

“Come on, Sparky! You can do it!” Olivia would cheer.

After a while, exhausted from running, Olivia flopped down on the grass, laughing. Sparky, after a few attempts at flying, landed beside her, puffing tiny smoke rings and resting his head against her arm.

“Maybe we could try a different game, Sparky,” Olivia suggested. “Let’s try I-Spy!”

Sparky tilted his head, a curious look in his golden eyes.

“Okay, I spy with my little eye, something green!” Olivia said.

Sparky looked around the garden, his gaze flitting from the green grass to the leaves on the trees. He chirped excitedly and then flew towards a small green frog sitting on a lily pad. He poked at the frog gently with his snout.

Olivia burst out laughing. "No, not the frog, Sparky! But close! It is green, too!" she said, then smiled as she continued. "Think bigger! Bigger and green!"

Sparky again took some time looking, and finally, with a happy squeal, he flew directly to the huge, luscious, green apple tree.

"Oh yes! the apple tree!" Olivia said as she walked with Sparky towards the apple tree. "Well done, Sparky!"

They played I-Spy for hours that afternoon, Sparky’s delight at correctly identifying objects, a source of immense amusement for Olivia. He kept finding the most interesting things, sometimes even getting them wrong. "I spy something... fluffy!" Olivia announced, gazing up at the fluffy, white clouds. Sparky, after surveying his surroundings, waddled towards the garden gnome. Olivia giggled until tears rolled down her face, wiping them off with a dirty finger.

As the days turned into weeks, Sparky grew bigger. He wasn’t quite big enough to ride, but his wings became stronger, and he could soar short distances. They had to move their hide-and-seek to larger areas of the house. Sparky began to get better at hiding and occasionally found surprising hiding places.

One rainy afternoon, curled up on the sofa together, Olivia, had an idea.

“Let's play riddles, Sparky!” she declared, her eyes shining.

Sparky chirped with enthusiasm, settling down next to her, his scales gleaming in the dim light.

Olivia thought hard, "Okay, I'm a green creature that hops, eats bugs, and likes water. Who am I?"

Sparky studied Olivia intently for a moment, and then began to run around Olivia's legs flapping his tiny wings. He looked so silly as his feet went crazy fast, making tiny steps, which brought her to giggles again.

Olivia had to make another go at explaining the clues, as she was laughing too hard. "Try again, Sparky! Listen closely. I hop, eat bugs, and live near water!"

Sparky paused in front of her and did his dragon chirps as if telling her he could not figure it out! He then gave Olivia a quick, affectionate nose bump. He then started zooming around again, stopping near the glass windows of the living room, so that she could hear him. He then stood straight up and looked straight out the window in the direction of the garden's water features.

Olivia thought about the riddles then as well and then remembered.

"Ahhh!" She exclaimed. "A frog! Is that who you thought?" She asked. Sparky chirped and flew onto Olivia's lap to cuddle in contentment.

They played riddles for hours, Olivia asking questions and Sparky trying to figure out the answers. They covered a lot of time together that day. Sparky learned new clues and got them spot on sometimes, while also enjoying a laugh from time to time.

One day, while they were playing hide-and-seek in the Whispering Woods, where Olivia had first found Sparky’s egg, they encountered a problem. They'd played this game many times here before, but today, Olivia stumbled upon a rather concerning sight.

“Sparky, look!” she called, her voice laced with worry. She pointed to a section of the forest where several large trees had been cut down, leaving a clearing littered with branches and sawdust.

Sparky landed beside her, tilting his head and looking at the scene. His small nostrils flared, as if he was picking up scents he didn't like.

"What's wrong?" he asked Olivia in a chirping tone.

“They’re cutting down the trees, Sparky! They’re destroying the forest,” Olivia said, her voice cracking with sadness. “And this is where you were born, isn't it?”

Sparky lowered his head, a flicker of sadness in his usually bright eyes. Then, suddenly, his head popped up. He chirped excitedly and pointed to the remaining trees with his little claw. Then flew to Olivia and gave her the puppy dog eyes.

“You want to do what?” Olivia asked, raising an eyebrow, feeling confused.

Sparky circled Olivia with his wings flapping. Then he began to fly to a tree and then came back to Olivia in order to beckon her to the spot where he would be going.

He then led Olivia further into the woods, stopping near a majestic old oak tree, its branches reaching towards the sky. Then Sparky nudged her with his snout, pointing upwards towards the tree.

"You want us to... climb?" Olivia said slowly.

Sparky chirped in affirmation, his eyes shining with excitement.

Olivia had never tried to climb an oak tree before. But Sparky was so eager, she had to try. Using all her strength, Olivia wrapped her arms around the trunk, and placed her feet against the sturdy roots and began to climb. Sparky stayed beside her, encouraging her with a few chirps as Olivia moved higher and higher in the tree. As they continued moving up the tree, the scenery around them unfolded in the form of an aerial landscape.

They climbed higher and higher, until they could see the clearing and the cut trees, giving Olivia a new perspective, along with a burst of determination to preserve the forest. Olivia then held Sparky tightly to her chest, smiling.

That night, at the dinner table, Olivia shared the news with her parents.

"They're cutting down the trees in the Whispering Woods," Olivia said, her voice filled with a sadness. "I don't want them to take away Sparky's home, and it's home to lots of other animals!"

Her parents exchanged concerned glances.

“Well, that is terrible news, Olivia,” her mother said, stroking her chin.

“Maybe we can do something about it,” her father added, who had been doing a lot of talking to his colleagues about the matter over the weeks.

The next morning, Olivia, armed with leaflets she had helped create, and Sparky by her side, went to the town square to join some of the protesters.

Sparky, who, even though his size was small, made all the kids smile as they passed, flew around the square, creating an atmosphere of hope and good cheer. The leaflets, covered in drawings by Olivia, showed the animals and the dragons, the importance of trees, and Sparky the dragon, and quickly became quite popular amongst the crowds, the locals as well as the reporters and the townspeople. The Mayor was surprised to find so many kids wanting to rally around this idea, so he came and spoke to Olivia and all the kids. He listened, as he smiled and bent down towards her. Olivia, holding Sparky, explained the importance of saving the forest for Sparky, her family, and everyone else as well!

Soon after, as the news reporters asked about the cute little dragon that was next to her, they also became a celebrity couple! Sparky, who in turn was also making his case for saving his home to reporters, also put the campaign on a worldwide scale, making people, as well as those big companies think, a thing of the past!

Within weeks, the Mayor announced that he has agreed to find a way to conserve the Whispering Woods. It was great news! The children as well as the protesters jumped for joy! Everyone cheered!

The woods would be safe. Olivia and Sparky had saved them, by coming together as best friends, as a couple, as partners in crime.

Back in their cozy room, after the celebrations, Olivia hugged Sparky tightly.

“We did it, Sparky! We saved the forest!” Olivia exclaimed, her voice filled with happiness.

Sparky nuzzled against her cheek, purring happily and flapping his wings with excitement.

“I love playing games with you, Sparky,” Olivia whispered, looking into Sparky’s bright, golden eyes.

Sparky chirped, nuzzling her again.
And Olivia and Sparky knew that their greatest game of all was to keep playing, with each other, to keep each other, and to keep on saving the world, one game at a time.
