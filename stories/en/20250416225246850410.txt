<title>Jasper's Jest for the Jellyfish</title>
<body>
"Barnaby! Bartholomew! Wait up!"

A small, sandy-colored crab scuttled furiously across the beach, his tiny claws kicking up puffs of sand. His name was Jasper, and he was trailing behind his two best friends, Barnaby and Bartholomew, who were much larger and bluer crabs, and seemingly much faster.

"What is it, Jasper?" Barnaby called back, pausing. Bartholomew, his pincers raised inquisitively, mirrored his friend's stance. They were perched on a glistening rock, observing the shimmering ocean.

Jasper finally reached them, puffing and panting. "Have you seen...have you heard...the jelly...the jellyfish?" He wheezed, trying to catch his breath.

"Jellyfish?" Bartholomew asked, his large eyes widening. "What about them?"

"They're... they're at it again!" Jasper declared, his voice regaining some of its usual zest. He was known throughout the beach for his jokes and his tendency to exaggerate.

Barnaby chuckled. "At it again? What exactly are the jellyfish 'at'?"

Jasper's eyes sparkled. "They're being... well, ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous!"

Bartholomew seemed genuinely intrigued. "Ridiculous how? Are they tangled in seaweed again? Or perhaps...performing some sort of... underwater ballet?" Bartholomew was prone to flights of fancy.

"Worse!" Jasper exclaimed dramatically. "They're... they're... giving each other nicknames!"

Barnaby and Bartholomew exchanged glances. "Nicknames?" Barnaby repeated, a touch of skepticism in his voice.

"Yes! And they're terrible! Utterly, hopelessly terrible!" Jasper confirmed, wiping a bit of sand from his eyes. "I overheard them earlier, huddled around Old Man Fitzwilliam's shipwreck."

Old Man Fitzwilliam’s shipwreck was a favorite spot for beach creatures. It had sunk long ago and had become a cozy home and meeting place for various types of marine life.

Bartholomew was now bouncing excitedly. "Oh, this sounds wonderful! Tell us, Jasper! What are these dreadful nicknames?"

"Alright, alright," Jasper agreed, a grin spreading across his face. "First, there’s Flouncy Flo, of course. You know her, always drifting about, flaunting her tentacles…"

"Yes, yes, we know Flouncy Flo," Barnaby interrupted impatiently. "What's her nickname?"

"Her nickname," Jasper announced with a flourish, "is… 'Wobbly Wonder'!"

Barnaby and Bartholomew stared at each other.

"Wobbly Wonder?" Barnaby echoed. "That’s not… terrible."

"It is to Flouncy Flo!" Jasper insisted. "She prides herself on her elegance! Imagine! 'Wobbly Wonder'!"

Bartholomew tilted his head. "Perhaps she's… secretly pleased."

"Doubtful!" Jasper said. "Then there’s Percy Plop… you know, that enormous jellyfish that always bumps into things?"

Both Barnaby and Bartholomew nodded, remembering Percy's clumsy antics.

"His nickname is… 'Bouncing Blob'!"

Barnaby burst out laughing this time. "That is quite accurate!"

"Precisely! And the best one," Jasper continued, lowering his voice, "is for Grizelda Goo… the one with the perpetually glum expression. They call her… 'The Gloomy Gel'!"

Bartholomew giggled, picturing Grizelda's typically mournful face. "Oh dear. I suppose that is rather apt."

"It's a complete jest!" Jasper declared. "And I've come up with one of my own. Something… much more suitable for them."

"What? Tell us!" Barnaby and Bartholomew both asked at once, suddenly very interested.

Jasper took a dramatic pause, savoring the moment. "Well, I think…" he said with a wink, "that Flouncy Flo should be known as… 'Floating Fury'."

Barnaby burst out laughing again. "Floating Fury! I love it! She does get quite grumpy if the tide’s not right."

"And Percy Plop?" Bartholomew asked eagerly.

"Percy Plop," Jasper announced, "shall now be called… 'Bouncing Ball of Blunders'!"

"Even better!" Barnaby exclaimed, slapping a claw on Bartholomew’s back, nearly knocking him over.

"And Grizelda Goo?" Bartholomew prompted, holding his balance.

"Grizelda Goo," Jasper declared, leaning closer to them conspiratorially, "is now… 'Griselda Grimace'."

Barnaby and Bartholomew looked at each other and then burst into laughter, clutching their sides. They continued to laugh for a long while, their mirth echoing across the beach.

"This is fantastic, Jasper!" Barnaby finally gasped, wiping away a tear. "But how are you planning to use this incredible…jest?"

Jasper's eyes twinkled. "I’m going to tell them, of course! Tonight, at the shipwreck!"

Bartholomew looked worried. "Are you sure, Jasper? The jellyfish are easily offended."

"Nonsense!" Jasper declared bravely. "It's all in good fun. Besides, they’ll appreciate the creativity!"

That evening, under the soft glow of the moon, the three friends made their way to the old shipwreck. The hull of the ship created shadows that danced on the sea bed. The familiar gentle sound of the water lapping against the wood comforted them as they approached their destination. They peered around the side of the wrecked vessel and saw the jellyfish gathered as predicted. Flouncy Flo, Percy Plop, and Grizelda Goo were all present, along with many other smaller, shimmering jellyfish. They looked so elegant and calm as they drifted through the water.

Jasper took a deep breath. "Okay, ready?"

Barnaby and Bartholomew nodded in agreement. They knew Jasper and were sure they would be a supporting force to give him courage.

Jasper stepped forward, trying to keep his voice from trembling. "Greetings, Jellyfish!"

Several jellyfish turned their large, translucent bodies towards him, their bellies glowing with an eerie light.

"I've… I've been hearing things," Jasper announced, gesturing towards them with his claws. "About… nicknames."

The jellyfish exchanged nervous glances.

"Yes," Flouncy Flo said cautiously, her tentacles shimmering in the moonlight. "We… have been engaging in a little lighthearted naming."

"Well," Jasper said, puffing out his chest, "I, too, have some…suggestions."

He paused dramatically. "Flouncy Flo," he said, pointing to her, "shall now be known as… Floating Fury!"

Flouncy Flo gasped, and her tentacles bristled slightly.

"Percy Plop," Jasper continued, turning to the clumsy jellyfish, "will henceforth be called… Bouncing Ball of Blunders!"

Percy Plop wobbled nervously, bumping into a small sea anemone in his confusion.

"And Grizelda Goo," Jasper declared, addressing the jellyfish with the sad expression, "is now… Griselda Grimace!"

Grizelda Goo did not react, other than to drift a little closer to the shadows cast by the wreck, almost blending into the dark depths.

A hush fell over the gathering. The other jellyfish whispered amongst themselves.

Flouncy Flo swam towards Jasper. "You… you think those names are better?" she demanded, her voice tinged with indignation.

"They're… much more fitting!" Jasper declared proudly.

Just then, from behind the shipwreck, a large, grizzled crab emerged. He was much bigger and older than Jasper, with thick, barnacle-covered claws. It was Old Man Fitzwilliam, the owner of the shipwreck and usually the one to tell all the other sea creatures stories.

"What's all the commotion?" he boomed, his voice rumbling like distant thunder.

The jellyfish, seeing the old crab's appearance, quickly began explaining what had occurred. Jasper's ears pricked up as he tried to get a sense of what was to happen.

"So, young Jasper," Old Man Fitzwilliam said, turning his gaze to the small crab. "You think your nicknames are… better?"

"Yes, sir," Jasper replied, squaring his shoulders. "More… descriptive."

Old Man Fitzwilliam chuckled, a sound like the shifting of sand. "And are these jellyfish any of the characters of your nicknames bothered by their characterization?"

He looked at each of the jellyfish, Flouncy Flo, Percy Plop and Griselda Goo in turn. There was a deep silence as the creatures gave their opinions in quiet murmurs to one another.

After a time, Grizelda Goo spoke, "I have no complaints to share regarding the new moniker that has been bestowed upon me."

"Same for me too" agreed Percy Plop.

"Perhaps the nicknames could have been slightly softened" countered Flouncy Flo, as she made a slow loop.

Old Man Fitzwilliam nodded thoughtfully. "Well, young Jasper, I am certainly glad you brought the matter up. You have given these Jellyfish new names. Perhaps these are not names they wish to be called, which shows their feelings."

"And perhaps", Fitzwilliam continued, with a wink towards Jasper, "you have given these jellyfish a way to discuss matters. You have, unintentionally, helped. It’s also true that nicknames can’t fully define us. We are all more than what we're labelled. Just like you, my boy."

He turned back to the jellyfish. "Now, how about a game of hide-and-seek in the ship? That should be a nice way to change the conversation, don’t you think?"

The jellyfish, forgetting their previous concerns, suddenly became excited. The prospect of the game quickly diverted their attention, their luminous bells shimmering with renewed joy.

Jasper, slightly deflated but not completely disappointed, smiled. "So... my jest, it was… appreciated?"

Old Man Fitzwilliam gave a hearty laugh. "Appreciated? Indeed! It stirred up a good discussion! And as long as it brings people closer, anything will be a fun tale!"

Barnaby and Bartholomew, beaming at their friend, added their encouraging nods, congratulating him for what he had achieved and what had come of it.

From that night on, the Jellyfish continued to give nicknames, and Jasper made up even more, but they all learned to understand that they are not what they are labelled. Jasper became even more known as the crab who started all the jest, but the story also reminds that the true value lies within.

The end.
