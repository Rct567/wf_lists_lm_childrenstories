<title>A Sweet Dream of a Friendly Unicorn’s Wonderful Flight</title>
<body>
"Wake up, Lily! Wake up!" a tiny voice squeaked.

Lily stirred, her eyelids heavy. "Mmmph… what is it, Rosie?"

Little Rosie, her best friend, a fluffy white rabbit with one ear perpetually flopped over, bounced on Lily’s bed. "You were dreaming again! And you were… giggling!"

Lily blinked. "Giggling? Was I?" She sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. "What was I dreaming about?"

Rosie's nose twitched. "It was something… sparkly! And with… a horn!"

"A horn?" Lily echoed, instantly intrigued. She loved fantastical stories. "Tell me everything!"

Rosie wriggled with excitement. "Well, first, you were in a meadow, full of the most amazing flowers! They shimmered with all the colours of the rainbow, like candy!"

"Candy flowers?" Lily gasped.

"Yes!" Rosie confirmed. "And then, out of the flowers, came… a unicorn!"

Lily's eyes widened. "A real unicorn?"

"The realest!" Rosie affirmed. "It was so fluffy, like a cloud! And its horn… it glowed! You kept reaching out to it, and then…" Rosie paused for dramatic effect.

"And then?" Lily prompted, practically bouncing with anticipation.

"It bent down and… you climbed on!"

Lily’s imagination took flight. "Wow! And then… what?"

"Then you flew!" Rosie declared, throwing her little paws into the air. "The unicorn soared through the sky, past the moon and the stars! You were laughing and laughing!"

Lily could hardly contain herself. "Did we visit anywhere interesting? Did we talk to anyone?"

"Oh yes!" Rosie exclaimed. "You talked to the moon! You asked it about its secret and how it glows so brightly. And the unicorn laughed, it has a giggle that sounds like little bells!"

"The moon's secret..." Lily whispered, captivated. "What was it?"

Rosie thought hard. "You can't remember, because you were too busy flying! It had something to do with sprinkles, and that’s all I can recall!"

Lily slumped dramatically. "Oh, too bad! I'll never know the moon's secret now."

"But you remember how happy you were, don't you?" Rosie asked, nudging her with her nose.

Lily grinned. "Yes! It sounded like the best dream ever. Tell me again, from the beginning!"

Rosie, delighted, started again, and Lily listened, picturing the candy flowers, the fluffy unicorn, and the sparkly sky. As Rosie recounted the adventure, the scene became clearer to Lily in her imagination, the sounds louder and she remembered other parts as well!

"The unicorn’s name was… Sky!" Lily said suddenly. "And Sky had the most beautiful eyes, the colour of amethysts!"

Rosie’s eyes sparkled with admiration. "That’s right! You remember! He spoke to you! What did he say?"

Lily concentrated, trying to recapture the dream's magic. "He said… 'The best journeys are those shared with friends.' He said it like a gentle breeze."

"Oooooh!" Rosie breathed. "He sounds lovely!"

"He was!" Lily said, feeling a surge of warmth in her chest. "And we flew past waterfalls of shimmering glitter, where tiny little fairies waved at us!"

"Fairies!" Rosie squeaked, thrilled. "Were they singing?"

"Oh yes," Lily confirmed, closing her eyes and humming a tune. "They were singing about friendship and kindness."

"And you talked to them?" Rosie asked, hanging on every word.

"Yes," Lily said. "We shared some cookies, from the unicorn's saddlebags, and talked of magical places."

"Did you talk about the clouds?"

Lily was starting to vividly experience this adventure. “Yes! We floated on the clouds like they were bouncy castles and we were flying over a city made of cupcakes. It was a place called Candytown! We even met the Candy King who asked us what's our favourite flavour of ice cream. ”

“What was the King like?” Rosie inquired eagerly.

“He was as soft as marshmallow and was made of different flavours, but his core was the sweetest cotton candy ever!”

Rosie blinked her small rabbit eyes. "Wow! You met a candy king!"

Lily was now fully immersed in the dream. “He gave us golden tickets, that gave us all sorts of candy! We even gave the unicorn his favourite, which was a double-scoop of bubblegum!"

“That’s fantastic!" Rosie exclaimed. "And did the unicorn like it?"

Lily giggled. "He loved it! He even sneezed a rainbow!"

Rosie giggled with her. "I wish I could have seen that!"

"You did!" Lily said with assurance. "You were there, Rosie. You were the one who saw the rainbow!"

Rosie thought for a moment. “I guess you are right. How did the flight continue, oh great story-teller of sweets?"

Lily smiled. "We flew over forests of lollipops. And Sky told me about the stars, they are like precious gems with wonderful histories. Each star tells a unique tale. He pointed to a cluster and told me the story of the Wishing Star. But before I heard it, I woke up!"

Rosie's little ears drooped slightly. "Oh, I wish you had not woken up."

"Me too," Lily said with a sigh. "But I have the feeling Sky will come back to me again."

"I am sure he will!" Rosie declared. "And maybe next time I can go with you!"

"I'd love that," Lily said, hugging her bunny friend. "Imagine, you riding on the unicorn with me!"

Rosie’s ears perked up immediately. "We could wear sparkly hats! And we could sing songs to the moon!"

Lily laughed, the dream’s happiness still bubbling inside her. "Yes! And we’ll collect all the secret moon sprinkles!"

They both sat for a while, sharing the delicious memory of Sky, Candytown and their shared sweet dream. They chatted about their favourite candy, which made them wish they could eat all sorts of sugary delights. Finally, Rosie jumped off the bed.

"I’m going to get a carrot now," she declared. "Maybe that can spark our dreams next time. It must be a sweet dream ingredient."

"Good idea!" Lily said. "I'll have an apple! And tonight, we will think about Sky again!"

Rosie nodded. "We should plant some candy flowers in the garden, so the unicorn knows where to come!"

Lily's eyes sparkled with a new idea. "And maybe we can build a runway so he doesn't have any issues with landing."

"Absolutely!" Rosie said enthusiastically. "A shimmering runway of friendship and candy sprinkles! Now, let's go get some dream ingredients!”

They ran out of the bedroom, the remnants of the sweet dream still clinging to their smiles, already planning their next adventure with Sky, the friendly unicorn. They went outside to the garden, full of anticipation, dreaming up exciting things they would build so the unicorn knew to visit their magical playground next time!
