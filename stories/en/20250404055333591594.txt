<title>The Ghostly Green Ghost</title><body>
Barnaby Button lived in a rather peculiar house. Not peculiar in the sense that it was crooked or falling apart, no, it was peculiar because of Penelope, the green ghost who lived in the attic. Barnaby wasn't scared of Penelope. In fact, he quite liked her. She was a friendly ghost, despite her rather translucent appearance and tendency to float through walls.

"Penelope?" Barnaby called, his voice echoing slightly as he climbed the creaky stairs to the attic. The air grew colder as he ascended, a telltale sign that Penelope was about.

"Coming, Barnaby!" A faint voice, like rustling leaves, drifted from the shadows. A moment later, Penelope, a swirling mass of emerald green, materialized near a dusty trunk.

"Good morning, Penelope!" Barnaby greeted cheerfully, already halfway across the room. He clutched a small, leather-bound book.

"And to you, Barnaby! What grand adventure do we have today?" Penelope swirled playfully, a faint green glow illuminating the dusty room.

"I've brought my new book of riddles!" Barnaby announced proudly, holding up the book. "It's got the trickiest riddles ever! I thought you might enjoy trying to solve them."

Penelope tilted her spectral head, her emerald eyes twinkling. "Riddles! I do love a good riddle. Though, being a ghost, I do sometimes get a 'head start' with the answers, if you catch my drift…" she chuckled, a sound like wind chimes.

Barnaby grinned. "Well, try not to peek! Here's the first one: I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?"

Penelope floated in a thoughtful circle, the faint green of her form pulsing gently. "Hmm… cities, forests, water… but none of the actual things… Is it a map?"

Barnaby's jaw dropped. "That was incredibly quick, Penelope!"

"Practice makes perfect," she said with a flourish. "Now, let's have another! I am always hungry; I must always be fed; the finger I lick will soon turn red. What am I?"

Barnaby pondered. "That's a tricky one… always hungry… must be fed… Hmm…" He tapped his chin. "Is it a fire?"

Penelope floated closer, her glow intensifying slightly. "Correct! Very good, Barnaby. Your riddles are indeed becoming more challenging. Are you ready for another?"

"Ready as I'll ever be!" Barnaby declared.

Penelope began to drift towards the trunk, seeming to gather herself to ask the next one.
"I am tall when I am young, and I am short when I am old. What am I?"

Barnaby pondered. The attic, usually bright with the afternoon sun filtering through the dusty windows, suddenly seemed darker and he scratched his head in confusion.
"Tall when I am young, and short when I am old... hmm..." Barnaby mused. "Is it a candle?"

"Precisely!" Penelope replied with a burst of emerald light, the colour of the leaves during springtime. "You are doing wonderfully."

Barnaby looked through his book and turned to the next riddle. "Okay, this one is a real brain-bender: What has an eye, but cannot see?"

Penelope hovered, the very air around her seeming to still while she processed the conundrum.
"That’s a very interesting one," she murmured. "Hmm… An eye, but cannot see… I believe the answer is a needle, isn’t it?"

"Wow, Penelope! You are amazing! Two for two! How do you do it?" Barnaby exclaimed.

Penelope smiled, a faint shimmer of amusement playing on her face. "Well, being a ghost has its advantages. I've had, shall we say, a bit more time to ponder these things than most… and, to be perfectly honest, I may have heard a few riddles or two in my time…" she trailed off mysteriously.

Barnaby giggled. He knew Penelope wasn’t giving away her secrets, and he didn’t mind at all. He loved her even with all her ghostly advantage!

He turned the page and read the next riddle. "Alright, this one's a tough one. What has to be broken before you can use it?"

Penelope thought for a moment. "A riddle about breakage... It is rather philosophical," she reflected. She floated back and forth in contemplation, casting off subtle flickers of luminous emerald that looked like miniature lightning bolts. After about one minute she stopped and smiled.

"Aha! The answer is an egg!"

"Amazing, Penelope! You're on a roll!" Barnaby cheered, thrilled.

He flipped the page again, seeking the next riddle. "Okay, are you ready for this one? What question can you never answer yes to?"

Penelope drifted a little closer to Barnaby, showing greater focus on this particular riddle. She paused and remained in place for a long while, clearly grappling with the phrasing of it.
"This one requires me to use all my accumulated intelligence," she conceded, her emerald presence dimmed slightly. After more than three minutes she sighed, softly.

"Barnaby, I must be honest and admit… this one has me stumped. I don't have an answer, which is unusual for me. You tell me."

Barnaby, puffed up with pride, was pleased to see that even Penelope could be stumped.
"Are you asleep yet?" he crowed.

Penelope responded immediately. "Brilliant! That's quite brilliant! I hadn't approached it that way. Well done, young Barnaby!" She offered Barnaby an appreciative smile and nodded. "That was excellent."

"Well, you're usually the riddle master, so it's nice for a change," Barnaby said happily. He felt like they'd established some good old friendly competitiveness between the two.

He proceeded through the next few riddles, but Penelope faltered a little. Sometimes she guessed correctly, sometimes not. They came across a variety of difficulties, which meant both were challenged. At one point she even floated through the ceiling accidentally, only to re-appear through the attic door.

Finally, as the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the dusty attic, Barnaby closed the book.

"That was fantastic, Penelope!" Barnaby declared, stretching. "Thank you for playing. I had such fun, as always."

"And I, you! It seems your riddles are improving, my friend. A good puzzle truly does exercise the mind," Penelope replied. She began to fade slightly, her green glow softening. "I do believe my usual nap time is approaching. Would you mind closing the attic door as you go?"

"Of course, Penelope," Barnaby said. He felt he had grown accustomed to closing the attic door at this time every afternoon.

"Excellent. Until tomorrow, then, Barnaby!" Penelope’s form flickered, and she began to become more translucent until she fully vanished, as usual.

Barnaby smiled. He walked to the door, closed it gently, and made his way down the creaking stairs, whistling a cheerful tune.

As he closed the door to his room and began to tidy his toys, he suddenly heard a faint whisper.

"Barnaby…?"

Barnaby's heart skipped a beat. "Penelope?" he whispered back, though he had a hunch this was just a coincidence.

"Yes… it's me," came the soft voice from the corner of his room, where the green ghostly presence emerged slightly from his wall.

"I… I got an itch!"

"Penelope, you can't get an itch, you're a ghost!"

"I know, but I do. Can you, perhaps, find a small item and rub it over the corner of the wall, by me? I can't scratch myself! It's just…" Penelope drifted awkwardly in midair. "It's just one of those ghostly annoyances…"

Barnaby grinned and understood what he had to do, of course. "I'll find you a duster!"

And that, as it happened, concluded Barnaby Button's afternoon, together with his dear, Green Ghost friend.
