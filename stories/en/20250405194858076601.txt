<title>Where Did the Rainbow Go?</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling hills dotted with fluffy sheep and sparkling, babbling brooks, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily wasn’t just any little girl; she possessed a heart as bright and colorful as a box of crayons, a spirit as free as a butterfly, and a head full of curious questions. Her best friend was Barnaby, a shaggy old sheepdog with eyes as kind as the sun.

One sunny afternoon, after a particularly delightful picnic involving strawberry tarts and lemonade, Lily and Barnaby were sitting on a grassy knoll, gazing at the sky. A gentle shower had just passed, leaving the world smelling of fresh rain and damp earth. And then, there it was! A magnificent rainbow, arching across the heavens like a giant, colorful bridge.

"Oh, Barnaby," breathed Lily, her eyes wide with wonder. "Look at it! It's so beautiful!"

Barnaby, who had seen countless rainbows in his long life, wagged his tail approvingly and let out a contented woof.

Lily, however, wasn't content just to admire. "I wonder," she mused aloud, her brow furrowing, "where does the rainbow go? Does it just… disappear?"

Barnaby tilted his head, as if pondering the very question. He couldn't answer, of course, but his look of profound thought encouraged Lily to further investigate her wonder.

"I'm going to find out!" she declared, jumping to her feet. "Come on, Barnaby! We're going on an adventure!"

And with a flurry of giggles and a happy bark from Barnaby, their quest began.

Their journey took them first to the Whispering Woods, a place filled with trees that seemed to whisper secrets to the wind. They carefully tip-toed through the tall trees, searching for a clue to the rainbow's whereabouts. The woods, usually vibrant with the chatter of birds and the scampering of squirrels, was unnaturally silent. The trees seemed to be watching them with the eyes of ancient, wise beings.

"Hello?" Lily called out softly, hoping to receive a response.

Suddenly, a tiny, glittering light appeared in front of them. It flitted and danced, leading them deeper into the woods. Following this mysterious light, they found themselves standing before a small, shimmering portal hidden behind a curtain of emerald green moss.

"What is that?" Lily whispered, captivated by the magical sight.

The light seemed to beckon them forward. Tentatively, Lily reached out and touched the shimmering surface. The portal rippled beneath her fingers, as if inviting her in.

"Are you sure, Lily?" Barnaby whimpered nervously, nudging her hand with his wet nose. He was always cautious, even though he usually supported Lily's adventures wholeheartedly.

"I think so, Barnaby," she said with a smile. "The rainbow has to go somewhere, right? Maybe this portal leads to where it lives."

With a deep breath, she stepped through the portal. Barnaby, never one to let his friend go alone, followed closely behind.

The moment they passed through, the world around them dissolved, replaced by a swirl of colors and the soft scent of wildflowers. They landed gently on a field of cotton candy clouds, each fluffy cloud shimmering with the light of a thousand stars. They were in the Land of Rainbows!

Here, the sky was constantly filled with rainbows of all shapes and sizes. Some arched gently, others spiraled playfully, and still others pulsed with an internal light. The ground was paved with shimmering cobblestones made of pure, solidified color, and waterfalls cascaded down cliffs of glistening crystal.

They were greeted by a small, sparkling creature with butterfly wings and a tiny horn. It introduced itself as Iris, a Rainbow Guardian.

"Welcome, Lily and Barnaby," Iris chirped, her voice like the tinkling of tiny bells. "We've been expecting you. You seem determined."

"You were!" Lily exclaimed, pointing to the swirling colors. "This place is amazing! But… where does the rainbow *go*?"

Iris giggled. "Ah, the great mystery! You see, rainbows are born from the sun's light and the raindrops. They appear when they must, for a brief time, to bring joy to the world, a promise after the storms."

She then explained that each rainbow, after its appearance, returned to this special place, where they could restore the colors, and also, sometimes, have a vacation, becoming clouds and rain. They didn't simply disappear; they returned to a home, ready for the next time.

"But why aren't there any rainbows outside right now?" Lily asked, her brow furrowed. The entire world suddenly appeared in her mind as she asked the question.

Iris sighed sadly. "There has been an incident," she confessed, her wings drooping. "The mischievous Gremlins, the cloud repairmen, have been causing chaos! They grew unhappy about the rainbows always outshining their hard work repairing the clouds, so they've been capturing the rainbows' colours, attempting to hide them!"

"Gremlins?" Lily said. "Why?"

"They believe it's their turn to have all the colours of the world to themselves," Iris explained, "which makes them sad."

Barnaby, always ready for action, let out a firm woof, as if saying, "We have a job to do!"

"Yes!" Lily cried, her eyes gleaming with determination. "We need to get the colours back! Where do these Gremlins live?"

Iris pointed towards a distant, shadowy valley. "They've hidden the colours in the Crystal Caverns of Gloom. Be warned; they're tricky little creatures."

And so, armed with Lily's courage and Barnaby's loyal companionship, they set off towards the Crystal Caverns.

The journey was fraught with challenges. They had to navigate winding paths through forests of swirling, purple fog. They dodged tricky traps set by the Gremlins, which included bouncing mushrooms and giggling stones. Barnaby proved to be a surprisingly agile guide, using his sense of smell to avoid hidden pits and his barking to warn of danger.

Finally, they arrived at the Crystal Caverns. The entrance was guarded by two grumpy Gremlins with tiny, pointed hats and mischievous grins.

"Halt!" squeaked one of the Gremlins. "You shall not pass!"

"We're here to get the colours back," Lily announced firmly.

The Gremlins burst into fits of giggles. "Oh, you silly humans! You'll never find them! They're locked up tight, and safe from harm!"

They pointed towards the entrance of the Caverns. "And we won't let you in."

Barnaby growled, baring his teeth, ready to protect his friend. Lily looked at Barnaby and smiled at his support, realizing a good thing to do,

Lily knew a fight wouldn't solve the problem. Instead, she hatched a plan. "Maybe if you weren't always in Gloom," she proposed, "you'd want colour back! After all, we humans work, too, and enjoy all that we do."

This did not appear to affect the grumpy gremlins. Lily decided to try again, this time focusing on how she had gotten there, and how fun it could be. "We have walked so much," Lily explained to the gremlins. "And you know, when we arrive, the very first thing we look for, is how the rainbows are looking, after they left!"

The gremlins seemed impressed.

"Why is that?" they asked.

"Well," Lily replied. "I remember it well! They do such lovely work bringing fun. Without them, the world just is no fun!"

With the surprise in their voices, they let Lily and Barnaby enter. They found the crystal cavern filled with hundreds of captured colours, swirling in glass jars. Red, yellow, blue, green, and everything in between. They were contained, silent.

The Gremlins themselves watched them, as their grins, turned to faces of concern.

Lily thought a moment. She then had an idea! With Iris's support, it did not even take long! She brought them outside and found more of her world. Lily got everyone involved, and the Gremlins learned the rainbows made the entire world seem so lively and so full of joy.

The very colours, however, had never been completely forgotten, as the rainbows' job was truly beautiful.

Once the colours were put back, and the Gremlins learned that they are useful to rainbows for maintenance purposes, Lily and Barnaby bid farewell to Iris and the Land of Rainbows. They stepped back through the portal, which vanished behind them, back into their world.

The sun was setting as they emerged, casting long shadows across the grassy knoll. The world was peaceful again.

As they looked at the sky, they saw something new. There was the rainbow, in its gorgeous splendor. Lily smiled, she saw it differently this time, it was not simply there and gone. The journey and effort she had done, to see it return, had changed her perspective.

"So," Lily said with satisfaction, her eyes shining, "now we know where the rainbow goes!"

Barnaby barked happily in agreement. And together, they both settled down to watch the rainbow fade, a memory of its colour-filled journey, knowing that they would, as well, watch it return. The Rainbow's beautiful colours, after all, promised fun and excitement, over and over, into their future. And that, they knew, was a beautiful thing indeed.
