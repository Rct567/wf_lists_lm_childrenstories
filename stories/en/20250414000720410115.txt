<title>Leo Lion and His Funny Prank Day at the African Savanna.</title><body>Leo Lion woke up with a wiggle in his whiskers. Today was the day! The annual Prank Day at the African Savanna! All the animals, big and small, gathered together for a day of laughter, giggles, and good-natured tricks. Leo, being the silliest and most playful lion in the pride, was practically bouncing off the sunny savanna.

He leaped out of his comfy den, a cozy cave nestled beneath a giant baobab tree, and stretched his powerful paws. “Roar!” he bellowed, but instead of a mighty lion’s roar, a tiny squeak came out. He chuckled, already the prankster in action! He had accidentally swapped his roar with a mouse's! He knew just who he was going to use the small roar on, Timmy Tortoise! He knew how Timmy had gotten a reputation for not being able to understand jokes.

Leo trotted out of the den and saw his best friend, Zola Zebra, already chomping on some delicious, long green grass. Zola was covered in perfectly patterned black and white stripes, a natural artist’s masterpiece. “Morning, Zola!” Leo greeted.

Zola lifted her head, her big, gentle eyes blinking. “Morning, Leo! Are you ready for the pranks?” she asked, a playful glint in her own eyes. Zola was also quite a prankster, although her style was usually more elegant and subtle.

“Absolutely!” Leo grinned, his mane swaying in the morning breeze. “I have a whole day of laughter planned!”

Their first target was Bartholomew Baboon. Bartholomew, a jovial baboon with a tuft of brown hair on top of his head, was known for his love of bananas. Leo and Zola quickly gathered a bunch of perfectly ripe bananas. Leo, remembering what his Mother always taught him about keeping a smile on someone's face first, decided to wrap the bananas up with fancy gift wrap before giving them to Bartholomew!

“What a lovely gift, how kind!”, Bartholomew exclaimed. The joy on Bartholomew's face was unmatched as he started ripping the wrapping paper with anticipation. But when he reached the bananas he saw that the bananas had all been peeled, replaced with an image of Bartholomew on a giant banana peel!

Bartholomew roared with laughter. “Well played, you two! Very well played!” he hooted, scratching his head.

Next, they went in search of Fiona Flamingo. Fiona, with her graceful pink feathers and long legs, was known for being a bit… well, dramatic.

“I think Fiona deserves the feather tickle!” Leo said with a mischievous grin, he gathered around twenty ticklish, soft feathers. They decided to work in groups, each holding a feather. The feathers were all tickling the soft underbelly of Fiona as they tried their best to make her laugh. 

Leo started the "tickle-fight" first, holding out the feather slowly at first. The soft, long feather softly touching Fiona's underbelly started making Fiona make giggly sounds and wiggle around. It quickly became unbearable, so that she started roaring in laughter! The other animals that were watching quickly joined in! The playful atmosphere felt like a gentle rain, sprinkling the savanna with laughter.

Fiona squealed. “Oh, you silly lions!” she laughed, tears of mirth streaming down her face.

Their final and most challenging prank of the morning was aimed at Reginald Rhinoceros. Reginald, with his tough hide and powerful horn, was not exactly known for his sense of humor. He was, however, known for his very, very particular taste in mud. He was very specific about which mud was his favourite.

Leo thought about this. "We must ensure it is muddy enough, but not TOO muddy", Leo stated, "We have to be careful, otherwise he won't like it!"

Leo, Zola, and the now-joined Bartholomew decided to construct a fake mud pit to prank Reginald. Zola suggested they use some finely-ground earth and water, Bartholomew wanted to add some funny smelling twigs, Leo had gathered the ingredients, with each one adding a different type of smell to it, the mixture already felt ridiculous and ready to go. Reginald came slowly, he stopped, smelled it and was surprised. 

"What is this?", he questioned! Leo and the other animals were looking around, scared. Leo took the plunge, "it's... for you Reginald!"

Reginald tentatively sniffed the mud, the smell changing, and his nose was soon to be filled with many strange smells, some good, some not as good.

To everyone’s surprise, Reginald took a mighty dive, but at the very last moment the mud, had turned into a giant bubble bath filled with sweet smelling honey!

Leo, remembering the 'trick roar', squeaked out loud as the water was splashing Reginald all over, who in a moment of absolute joy erupted into laughter!
"What a day!" Reginald boomed.

In the afternoon, they encountered Sammy Snake, who was a big fan of riddles. Leo decided to change the traditional approach to this with riddles on banners, attached to flying ants.

He created some fun, clever riddles to fly through the savanna, including the riddle: “I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?" with the answer being a map! The flying ants carried the banners towards Sammy who was ecstatic about all the effort. The other animals soon became eager to partake in the activity. Sammy started to ask others questions and before long, the savanna was filled with loud shouts and cheers!
Everyone had lots of fun, especially Sammy!

Leo and his friends didn’t stop there! They devised even more hilarious pranks for the remainder of the day! Leo replaced all the berries that Celeste Cheetah collected, with googly eyes. Celeste initially got worried but quickly became overjoyed with the transformation.

Towards the evening, Leo decided to go and find the sleepy Timmy Tortoise. He still had the silly tiny squeak. He gently walked towards Timmy, who was fast asleep and, just at the right time, roared the tiniest squeak, that woke him up!

Timmy grumbled. "Was that you Leo?", and before he knew what he had been asked he joined in to partake with the others, and soon was filled with joy.
After a long day of joyful laughs, Leo Lion and his friends gathered under the starlit African sky, completely spent from laughter. Leo felt a warm feeling inside, knowing how many smiles he had spread throughout the day. It was truly a great day to make all of his best friends laugh with joy.

The pranks had brought the savanna community closer together, reminding them that life was meant to be fun and silly, and the very best days are spent with friends, laughter and smiles. The feeling of love, laughter and companionship was shared through the Savannah and all of the animals were thankful to Leo for making them feel like part of one big family!
The memory of that prank day stayed with everyone forever, reminding them to embrace their silly side, to find humor in every moment, and to always be kind and bring smiles to others.
And from that day forward, the yearly Prank Day at the African Savanna, became Leo Lion's favorite day of the year. It also cemented his reputation as the king of fun.
