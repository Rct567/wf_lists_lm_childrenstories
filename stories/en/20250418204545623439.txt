<title>A Sleepwalking Elephant’s Unexpected Trip Around the Globe</title><body>Once upon a time, in the lush green heart of the African savanna, lived an elephant named Elara. Elara wasn't just any elephant; she was a sleepwalking elephant! Every night, under the silvery glow of the moon, Elara would drift off to sleep, and then, her enormous, grey feet would begin to wander. No one quite knew where she would end up. Sometimes she’d visit the nearby watering hole, other times, she'd find herself amongst the giggling giraffes. This nighttime escapade was a complete mystery to her, as she would wake up in her cozy bed, oblivious to the adventures she had embarked on while everyone else slept.

One warm evening, after a particularly long day of splashing in muddy puddles and munching on juicy acacia leaves, Elara yawned a tremendous yawn that nearly touched her tusks together. “Good night, everyone!” she trumpeted, curling up under a large baobab tree, using its gnarled roots as a pillow. The other animals, including her best friend, a cheeky monkey named Mika, wished her good night. Mika had tried, several times, to follow Elara on her nighttime walks, but she was always too quick for him, disappearing into the darkness before he could even swing out of his tree.

As the moon climbed high in the inky sky, bathing the savanna in a pearly light, Elara's breathing became deep and rhythmic. Suddenly, her eyes flickered open, and without a sound, she began to walk. Her massive frame glided through the tall grasses, leaving a wide trail. Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, Elara wasn't just wandering around the familiar savanna. Tonight, Elara was on a world tour!

First, her sleepwalking feet carried her towards the coast. She lumbered through dense jungles, carefully avoiding the sleeping hippos, and eventually, she arrived at a shimmering, moonlit beach. The sand was soft and cool under her feet. And then, something unexpected happened. She stepped into a boat. It wasn't just any boat; it was a large cargo ship. Apparently, the ship's captain, a jolly man with a booming laugh named Captain Bartholomew, had a penchant for taking in lost and wandering creatures. Finding Elara sleeping peacefully near the docks, Captain Bartholomew, with a twinkle in his eye, decided to give her a ride. He gently steered her aboard, figuring that a little sea voyage might do the sleepwalking elephant some good.

The ship began to move. As the sun rose, Elara, still asleep, began her journey across the vast Atlantic Ocean. The waves gently rocked the ship, and Elara, feeling the gentle motion, began to dream of fluffy clouds and delicious mangoes.

Next thing she knew, she was in a bustling city! The cargo ship had docked in a city bustling with colourful houses and narrow streets, surrounded by charming restaurants and street markets in South America. Still in a slumber, she began her grand tour. She gently walked down cobblestone streets, marveling at the lively atmosphere. Locals, though surprised to see a large elephant in their city, took it in stride. Some children, giggling, offered her handfuls of sugarcane, which she ate contentedly.

Elara's journey wasn’t only land-based. After enjoying some sugarcane and strolling through South American streets, Captain Bartholomew realised he needed to continue his journey, so they went back to the sea. Elara had no memory of this adventure, only waking up again, now far away. This time, the ship crossed the Pacific Ocean and found herself in a land of shimmering lights and majestic temples. She found herself exploring a vast jungle in Asia, where she walked between ancient trees, the air filled with the scent of exotic flowers. Monkeys chattered overhead, and brightly coloured birds flew from branch to branch, seeming to wave hello to their wandering friend. She even, in her sleep, sampled some delicious, fragrant spices that were laid out to dry in the sun, completely oblivious of how it made her snort.

The ship continued to travel. Sometimes, she'd awaken briefly on decks, confused, only to fall back into her slumber once again. Next, Elara's journey took her to Europe. Imagine the scene: Elara, peacefully sleepwalking through Paris! She strolled past the Eiffel Tower, a giant silhouette against the dark sky, causing some late-night picnicking couples to gasp and giggle. She then ambled down the Champ-Élysées, with her trunk gently touching the elegant boutiques. Further, she visited Rome, her grey form a stark contrast to the ancient ruins and majestic statues. She must have seen so many sights!

Her tour didn't end there. Soon, Elara and her boat, now almost at the end of their journey, made it to North America. They sailed the coasts and she found herself, by now, accustomed to this new travelling sensation. She strolled through sunny farmlands and saw tall buildings of modern cities. Captain Bartholomew tried to take her back to Africa. On this particular day, a storm rose. The waves began to rock the boat violently and the rain lashed against the windows. Elara's sleep was disturbed. She felt a wave of discomfort and started to become increasingly unsettled.

She was having a strange dream; a series of fragmented images whizzed by. She saw rolling waves, unfamiliar cities, and an unending sky. The rain and storm continued, until a clap of thunder struck her and jolted her from her sleep. She was awake!

The sudden awakening startled her. She blinked her large eyes, confused, and looked around. Her enormous eyes took in the surroundings. There she was, on a rocking ship, soaked and shivering. She wasn’t in her bed anymore, this was clear. This wasn’t the savanna. What was going on?

Captain Bartholomew, relieved to see her awake and safe, greeted her warmly. "Well, good morning, sleepyhead! It's about time you woke up! We're heading back to Africa now, but you’ve seen quite a lot. You have to see Africa and appreciate your home."

Elara was understandably confused. “Africa? But…where am I? What happened?” she trumpeted, her trunk drooping with a mix of fatigue and bewilderment. Captain Bartholomew chuckled and explained her incredible, around-the-world adventure, showing her a map marked with all the places she had visited.

As Captain Bartholomew explained, Elara slowly began to remember vague flashes of her sleepwalking escapade: the sugarcane, the cobblestone streets, the bright lights, the tall buildings. The sights, the sounds, the feeling of the ground under her feet! Everything came rushing back. She giggled, a deep, rumbling sound that shook the ship. "Wow!" she exclaimed.

When they finally reached the shores of the African savanna, the sun was just beginning to set, painting the sky in brilliant shades of orange and pink. As Elara stepped onto the familiar ground, she felt a wave of contentment wash over her.

Mika, her monkey friend, spotted her from afar, and shrieked with joy. He came racing to greet her, swinging from the branches. "Elara! You're back! We've missed you!" he chattered excitedly.

Elara nuzzled Mika, feeling a renewed appreciation for her home and her friends. Though her travels were an incredible experience, she learned there's no place like home.

That night, as the moon shone brightly, Elara climbed back under her beloved baobab tree, ready to sleep. This time, though, instead of sleepwalking, she dreamt of the adventures she had enjoyed. She dreamt of South America, Asia, Europe, and America, all of it a joyful mix of sights and experiences. She still smiled, but this time, her smile didn't involve moving, because from that day on, she kept her sleepwalking trips for the daytime. From then on, every time Elara closed her eyes at night, she knew that the world was ready for a new, safe, and wonderful trip with her. She would travel as she wanted to; around the globe, her dreams, and her heart would be her compass. The other animals of the savanna would look up to Elara’s adventure. With this new mindset, all of Elara’s travels would now begin, never again with her sleepwalking journeys. And every morning, as she woke up, Elara would smile at the thought of her upcoming adventures and start looking around, prepared and excited to see what the new day would bring!
