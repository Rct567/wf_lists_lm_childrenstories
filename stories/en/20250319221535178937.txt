<title>Finding a Rainbow After the Rain on Tuesday Morning.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a cozy little town nestled beside a sparkling blue river, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily had bright, sunshine-yellow hair, eyes like the clearest summer sky, and a giggle that sounded like wind chimes in the breeze. She loved Tuesdays. Tuesdays were special because that was the day her grandma, Nana Willow, came to visit. Nana Willow always brought the best treats – warm, buttery scones and juicy, sweet strawberries.

But this Tuesday morning was a bit different. Lily woke up to a gray, gloomy sky. Raindrops tapped softly against her window, making a gentle, rhythmic drumming sound. “Oh dear,” sighed Lily, snuggling deeper under her covers. “Rain means I can’t play outside, and Nana might not be able to come.”

Lily’s tummy rumbled, reminding her it was breakfast time. She slowly climbed out of bed and padded to the kitchen, her little bare feet silent on the wooden floor. Her parents were already there, looking a little bit glum too.

“Good morning, sleepyhead,” said her mom, smiling weakly. “It’s raining quite a bit, isn’t it?”

Lily nodded, her bottom lip quivering. “Will Nana Willow still come?”

Her dad gave her a reassuring hug. “We’ll call her, sweetie. Maybe she can drive slowly.”

After a breakfast of warm porridge and a slice of toast, Lily and her parents settled into the living room. The rain continued to pour, splashing against the windows. Lily tried to read her favorite book, “The Adventures of Barnaby Bear,” but her mind kept wandering. She was worried about Nana Willow and the weather. She missed her grandmother's stories and her warm hugs.

Suddenly, the lights flickered, and the room went dark. “Oh no!” exclaimed her mom. “A power outage!”

Lily gasped. The house felt even gloomier now. Without the lights, and with the rain coming down so hard, everything felt a little scary. Her dad quickly found some candles and matches. He lit a few candles, placing them safely on the coffee table. Their dancing flames cast flickering shadows on the walls, making strange shapes.

“Let’s make it an adventure, Lily-pad!” said her dad, trying to sound cheerful. “We can tell stories by candlelight!”

Lily's mom agreed, “Yes, it’s like camping indoors!”

Lily slowly started to feel a little better. Story time was always a fun idea. Her dad started by telling a silly story about a grumpy squirrel who accidentally became a superhero. Her mom followed with a tale about a brave little mouse who found a giant cheese wheel. Lily added her own stories, too, about talking flowers and dancing clouds.

As they told stories, the rain gradually started to slow down. The drumming on the windows became less frequent, until finally, it stopped. Lily peeked through the window. The sky was still cloudy, but the air felt fresh and clean. A small, tentative patch of blue peeked out from behind a gray cloud.

Then, Lily saw it.

“Look! Look!” she shouted, pointing towards the sky.

Her parents looked up and gasped. Arching across the sky, brilliant and bright, was a rainbow! It stretched from one end of the town to the other, its colors vibrant and shimmering. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – all of them!

“Wow!” breathed her dad.

“It’s the most beautiful rainbow I’ve ever seen,” said her mom, her eyes wide with wonder.

Lily ran to the front door and flung it open. The air smelled of wet earth and fresh flowers. The rainbow seemed so close, like she could reach out and touch it. She stepped outside onto the porch, the cool, damp air washing over her.

Just then, a car pulled up in front of the house. It was Nana Willow! Lily squealed with delight and ran down the path to greet her.

Nana Willow hopped out of the car, her cheeks flushed with excitement. “My dear Lily!” she exclaimed, her voice brimming with happiness. “Did you see the rainbow? It was just so beautiful, I knew I had to come and see you!”

Lily hugged her grandma tightly. “Nana, you’re here! And the rainbow is amazing!”

Nana Willow laughed, her eyes sparkling. “Indeed it is. And look!” She reached into her car and pulled out a basket. “I brought extra strawberries this time! And look, a small rainbow cake that the bakery made this morning after the rain!”.

Lily grabbed the basket, her face lighting up. “Strawberries! Yay!”

They went inside, leaving the door open so they could admire the rainbow. The candles still flickered, casting a warm glow on the living room. Lily, Nana Willow, her mom, and dad gathered around the table. They ate strawberries, a piece of the rainbow cake, and Nana Willow told them the stories. The stories made everyone giggle. It was even better than a normal Tuesday because it was special and made them feel loved. The rainbow outside served as a reminder of happiness, and a beautiful sign after the rain.

Later, as the sun began to peek through the clouds, painting the sky with streaks of pink and gold, the rainbow slowly began to fade. But Lily didn't mind. She knew the colors were safely locked in her memory. She looked at her Nana Willow, snuggled close beside her. This was the best Tuesday ever. It was a day filled with unexpected adventures, the magic of a beautiful rainbow, and the love of her family. And although the power was out for a short period of time, it only brought the family closer together. It was a Tuesday morning that would stay with Lily forever, a reminder that even after the rain, there’s always a rainbow to be found, especially when shared with the people you love. As she said goodbye to her Nana at the end of the day, Lily was already looking forward to the next Tuesday and any unexpected rainbow it might bring.
