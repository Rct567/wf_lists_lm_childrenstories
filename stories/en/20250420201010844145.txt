<title>Sharing Cookies With Special Animals</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a cozy little cottage nestled beside a whispering willow tree, lived a cheerful little girl named Lily. Lily had bright, sparkling eyes, rosy cheeks, and a smile that could light up the whole world. She loved baking cookies more than anything! Her kitchen was always filled with the delicious aroma of vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon.

One sunny morning, Lily decided to bake a huge batch of her famous chocolate chip cookies. She hummed a happy tune as she measured flour, cracked eggs, and stirred the butter and sugar together. The smell of the cookies baking in the oven made her tummy rumble with anticipation.

"These cookies are going to be the best ever!" she exclaimed to her fluffy white cat, Snowball, who was perched on the windowsill, watching her intently. Snowball blinked his big green eyes as if to agree.

When the cookies were finally golden brown and perfectly crispy, Lily carefully took them out of the oven. She placed them on a wire rack to cool, then spent the rest of the morning decorating them with colorful sprinkles and delicious chocolate chips.

"These are too good to keep all to myself," she thought. "I should share them!"

Lily decided she would share her cookies with some special animals in the forest near her cottage. She packed a basket filled with her warm, freshly baked cookies and set off on her adventure.

First, she walked towards the babbling brook, where she knew lived a wise old owl named Professor Hoot. Professor Hoot was known for his vast knowledge and his love for delicious treats. Lily found him perched on a branch, wearing his spectacles and looking very thoughtful.

"Good morning, Professor Hoot!" Lily called out, holding up her basket.

Professor Hoot blinked his big yellow eyes. "Good morning, Lily! What do we have here?"

"I baked some cookies," Lily said, offering him a chocolate chip cookie. "Would you like one?"

Professor Hoot’s eyes widened. He hooted with delight, took the cookie, and nibbled it with obvious enjoyment. "These are simply splendid, Lily! Thank you!" He declared, after finishing the cookie in two bites.

"I'm glad you like them!" Lily said. "I've got plenty more to share!"

Next, Lily decided to visit the playful squirrels. They lived in the tallest oak tree in the forest, and Lily knew they loved anything crunchy and sweet. She scampered over to the giant oak and called up to them.

"Hello, Squirrels! I have cookies!"

Immediately, a flurry of bushy tails and tiny paws appeared. Several squirrels scampered down the tree, chattering excitedly. They quickly surrounded Lily.

"Cookies! Cookies! For us?" one of them squeaked.

"Yes! For you!" Lily said, laughing, and handed out a few cookies to the eagerly awaiting squirrels.

The squirrels snatched the cookies and, with rapid little motions, began munching and scampering up the tree again. They kept dropping crumbs, and Lily laughed heartily at how quickly they vanished from her eyesight.

With each cookie disappearing, Lily laughed joyfully as she watched the flurry of tails and playful paws. "These squirrels are just wonderful!" She thought.

Lily watched them finish the cookies and giggled. "That was so much fun! But, let me go!"

Lily still had more cookies in her basket. Her next visit was to the shyest creature in the forest: a little deer named Dottie. Dottie had big, gentle eyes and a coat the color of autumn leaves. She was often hidden behind the bushes, peering out at the world with curious glances.

Lily carefully tiptoed through the woods, following a well-worn path, calling softly, "Dottie? Dottie, are you there?"

After a little while, a small, timid face peeked out from behind a thicket of bushes. It was Dottie, her big brown eyes filled with a cautious curiosity.

"Hello, Dottie," Lily whispered gently. "I have some cookies for you."

Dottie hesitated, then slowly stepped out of the bushes. Lily knelt down, offering her a cookie.

Dottie cautiously took the cookie with her delicate little lips, then devoured the sweet baked treat slowly, savoring every crumb.

"Thank you," she whispered, her voice as soft as the rustling leaves.

Lily smiled. "You're very welcome, Dottie. I am happy you liked it."

Dottie continued to nibble her cookie until she was gone. Her eyes gave out a sparkle, she thanked Lily again with a soft neigh, and she quickly disappeared back into the forest with all her graceful steps.

Lily felt warm all over as she observed how well she made this little deer smile. After watching Dottie’s disappearance, Lily smiled and continued to explore the woods.

With the warm feeling of seeing her cookies enjoyed by a dear, Dottie, Lily felt like exploring more of the forest, she heard a happy rumble from behind some thick shrubbery,

"Woof! Woof! Cookies?"

Behind the bush was a big, friendly dog, who everyone called "Buddy". Buddy loved playing in the woods and was known throughout the woods as a real cookie-loving pooch. He had a long, floppy tail that wagged so hard it seemed to move his entire body.

"Buddy, is that you?" Lily laughed, coming out of the shadows and towards him. "Yes, I baked cookies and I thought I'd bring some to you, too!"

Buddy barked happily, his tail wagging so fast he nearly tripped over himself.

Lily giggled as she bent down and gave Buddy a few cookies. Buddy promptly started devouring them with great joy and great relish! Crumbled cookie pieces tumbled everywhere!

Lily and Buddy continued to have fun for a while until there was barely any cookie left in the basket. As the basket went empty, Lily sighed and patted her belly.

"Well, it’s been a day of sharing for sure!" Lily said.

Buddy wagged his tail again. It looked like the cookie had made his day!

"I have really shared all the cookies in this basket," Lily continued, addressing her little dog and the rest of her animal friends, "And it was such an experience!"

Lily was feeling very happy as she started for home. As she waved her hand for the last time to her friends from the forest, Lily noticed one cookie remaining in her basket, she smiled; the one last remaining cookie.

"Hmm," she pondered "I didn't get to share one of these with Snowball!"

Quickly, she picked up the one last cookie and decided to rush towards the house!
As Lily walked back towards her little cottage, she heard a faint sound of chirping coming from the big willow tree. She looked up and saw a tiny bird with a bright yellow beak and bright-coloured wings.

"Hello, little bird!" Lily said. "Would you like a cookie?"

The tiny bird chirped happily and hopped down to take the cookie from Lily's hand. She munched it quickly.

"Oh, what is that I see on your foot!"

Lily stared into the bright wings, observing that the tiny bird’s foot was tied by some strings, maybe left by another unkind human, so Lily quickly got the tools needed to help him out, gently. Lily carefully cut the string to save the little bird and looked at the happy chirping bird. Lily understood what the bird was implying. The bird must have been suffering a lot.

After finishing her task, Lily got back into her path. She knew she should arrive home, as it was becoming very dark. Lily felt a new level of satisfaction, that even she was able to solve some problem she found, and even, Lily was finally seeing the importance of helping others around us.

Lily got home, and found Snowball in the windowsill like he usually does. "Here you go, Snowball!" Lily said.

Snowball blinked, then cautiously took the cookie from Lily's hand and ate it. Lily patted her cat, and looked at him in wonder and admiration. Lily thought of sharing. The thought made her joyful, knowing the other special animals were pleased to be able to share her food. The thought that everyone will love Lily for her generous love and efforts made her joyful and joyful!
She knew she wanted to do this again, as every one of her friends had made her day!

Lily knew, after today's adventures, she was so excited and that there were many other animals waiting to share cookies! This day of sharing cookies had made her incredibly happy, and she couldn't wait to bake more cookies for her special friends in the forest, for many days ahead, as all she wants is to bake all the cookies and distribute to everyone, even in the sky and beyond the skies! And they all lived happily ever after!

The End.
