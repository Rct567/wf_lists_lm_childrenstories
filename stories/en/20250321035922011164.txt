<title>How Humphrey Hippo Learned to Love Swimming in Sparkling Seas.</title><body>
Humphrey Hippo was a grumpy hippo. He lived in a large, grassy meadow beside the sparkling sea. The sea was blue, sometimes green, and always, always sparkling. Other hippos loved to swim in it. They'd splash and play, diving and twirling in the cool water. But not Humphrey.

Humphrey preferred the dry land. He loved to munch on the long, green grass, to bask in the warm sunshine, and to watch the fluffy clouds drift by. The sea, with its salty water and slippery rocks, held no appeal for him. He much preferred the comfort of the meadow, where he felt safe and secure.

Every day, his family and friends would urge him to join them. “Come on, Humphrey!” his sister, Henrietta, would call. “The water is lovely today! It’s perfect for a dip!”

“No, thank you,” Humphrey would grumble, his voice deep and rumbling. “The land is just fine.”

His best friend, Horace, a cheerful hippo with a splash of sand always clinging to his fur, would try to persuade him as well. "But think of all the fun, Humphrey! You can race! You can do somersaults! The waves are calling your name!"

"Waves," Humphrey would say, wrinkling his nose. "Just a lot of wetness, if you ask me. And cold wetness at that. I’d much rather stay right here."

He'd watch them from the edge of the meadow, his heart filled with a strange mixture of envy and irritation. He wished he could enjoy himself like the other hippos, but the thought of getting wet filled him with dread. He didn't understand why they loved it so much.

One sunny afternoon, a storm brewed. The sky turned a dramatic grey, the wind began to howl, and dark, ominous clouds gathered over the sea. The hippos playing in the water squealed with excitement. They knew a good storm often meant bigger waves to ride, so they laughed and swam harder, anticipating the thrill. Humphrey, however, retreated further into the meadow, pulling his great, grey bulk under the shade of a large baobab tree.

The first raindrops began to fall, large and heavy. Soon, the storm unleashed its fury. The wind howled like a hungry beast, whipping the sea into a frenzy of whitecaps. The hippos scrambled towards the shore, laughing and struggling against the powerful waves. They'd turn, ride with joy to shore and then turn again towards the waves. They all were having fun.

Then, a particularly large wave, a towering wall of water, crashed down on Horace. Humphrey saw him go under the surface, disappearing from sight. Humphrey, forgetting his usual aversion to the sea, lumbered towards the water's edge, his heart pounding. He saw Horace, far out, struggling. He couldn't see Humphrey, just flailing with wide eyes.

He took a few clumsy steps and then hesitated. He hadn’t been this close to the water for many years, even under the shade of the Baobab tree, the sea felt too near.

But the sight of Horace in distress spurred him on. He knew he couldn't just stand there. With a deep breath, he plunged into the turbulent water. The cold shock of the water almost made him stop, he started to sink under the power of the waves and the current. His fur felt icy. He quickly paddled toward the churning sea, his clumsy legs and powerful build helping him to cut through the powerful waves. He didn't care.

The waves slammed against him, pushing and pulling him in different directions, he swallowed the salty sea water, stinging his eyes and filling his lungs with more water. But he kept going, spurred on by his deep need to help Horace.

Finally, he reached him. Horace, gasping and exhausted, looked up at Humphrey with relief, although looking less scared than when he'd seen Humphrey before. He opened his mouth but all Humphrey saw was a lot of sea water. Humphrey was strong and knew his only job was to help Horace now.

Humphrey pushed Horace towards the shore, keeping his head above the waves as best as he could. It was slow going. The storm was relentless. But they kept going, and Humphrey kept supporting his best friend, both struggling against the furious sea, which wanted them to go further out, to never return to land. He saw that it was a mistake for him to fear this ocean. He was built for this water.

At last, they reached the shallows, stumbling onto the sand, the water finally releasing its fierce grip. Exhausted, they collapsed onto the beach. Humphrey shook the water from his thick fur, gasping for breath, the pain that he was in slowly replaced by the relief that Horace was safe.

Horace coughed and spluttered, wiping the salty water from his eyes, but his smile quickly returned as he opened his eyes.

"Thank you, Humphrey," he said, his voice hoarse. "You saved me."

Humphrey, panting, gave a gruff, embarrassed cough. He was wet, cold, and shivering, but he also felt an unfamiliar warmth spread through him, something far more comforting than the sunshine.

"Don't mention it," he mumbled, a strange lightness in his heart.

As the storm began to subside, and the sun peeked through the retreating clouds, casting a soft, golden light on the sparkling sea, Humphrey looked at the water, at the now calmer waves with a different perspective. It was no longer just a threatening barrier, or a place to be avoided. Now, he understood. He looked back at Horace, who was just watching, and the smile didn't fade, the warm gratitude in the eye was reassuring.

The other hippos gathered around them, relieved and happy.

"You were amazing, Humphrey!" Henrietta said, nuzzling him with her snout.

"You were so brave!" exclaimed another.

Humphrey, surprised by the attention, felt his gruffness melting away. He had always admired them, and he'd had an excuse to see them at their best, helping people out of the same water he avoided.

As the storm finally passed and the skies cleared, the sunlight danced upon the water, creating a thousand sparkling diamonds.

Then, Horace jumped back in and waited for Humphrey. "Come on, Humphrey! The water feels so nice!"

For the first time, Humphrey did not hesitate. He looked at the sparkling sea and knew that it wasn't a place to be feared but a place to be loved. He looked back at the grass, but he also looked back at Horace. Slowly and deliberately, he moved forward and followed Horace into the gentle water.

He took a tentative step in. He went a little deeper.

He felt the cool water against his warm fur. He felt the gentle waves, that helped hold him. He slowly started to enjoy himself and was no longer afraid.

He waded further in. Then, he began to splash, not in the desperate fear of before, but with a child's pure joy. He enjoyed splashing the gentle waves onto Horace and his sister, watching his family having such fun, he saw that what the others loved so much. And then he just began to move.

He dipped under the surface and opened his eyes, even though he was used to the clear water and sunlight that only land could provide, this new, blue world was fascinating.

The world was so large, so exciting. He tried to imagine the world, underwater, as one that he may stay in for good.

He blew bubbles. He tried a somersault. It wasn't as easy as the other hippos made it look, but he tried to make it perfect for a good smile. He realised the sea, in the way the sun always shone down, held him and let him swim. And then he did it! It was his first time!

He felt a surge of exhilaration and laughed, a deep, rumbling laugh that echoed across the sea, it didn't need the grass. And then the sea got even better. Humphrey had not been able to do somersaults as quickly, as high or for long as the other hippos.

Horace and Henrietta cheered and cheered as they were so happy to be spending the day with Humphrey.

"Come on, Humphrey!" they called and he was as happy as them. "Try this!"

"Try that!"

"Go! Go!"

As he felt his true comfort grow and grow. He spent the next few days learning the sea as well as it could be learnt. From playing, to diving, and of course, how to stay on the ground, the sea was his friend.

From that day on, Humphrey Hippo was no longer a grumpy hippo. He was a happy hippo, a hippo who loved swimming in the sparkling seas. He spent his days splashing, playing, and exploring the underwater world. And whenever he looked at the ocean, the same place he had used to fear, his heart would be filled with a warmth he hadn't known before. A warmth he didn't even know he'd wanted. He looked down at his friends and laughed again, because now Humphrey understood: True joy could be found in the most unexpected places, even in the depths of the sparkling sea.
