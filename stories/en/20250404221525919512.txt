<title>Liam Likes Lovely Llamas</title>
<body>
"Mama, Mama! Wake up!" cried Liam, bouncing on his bed.

"Mmm, what is it, sweetie?" mumbled Mama, blinking in the morning light.

"Today's the day! Today's the day!" Liam squealed, his eyes sparkling.

"The day for what, my little llama lover?" Mama chuckled, pushing herself up in bed.

Liam gasped dramatically. "For the Llama Lollapalooza, of course! Don't you remember? We're going to the llama farm!"

Mama sat up straighter. "Oh! Goodness, I almost forgot! Yes, the Llama Lollapalooza. Time to get ready, then!"

Liam leaped out of bed and zoomed around the room, gathering his favourite blue t-shirt (decorated with a sparkly llama) and his special llama-shaped backpack. "Hurry, Mama! Hurry! I want to see all the lovely llamas!"

Mama smiled, shaking her head. "Alright, alright. Let's get some breakfast. Pancakes sound good?"

"Pancakes! With syrup! And maybe some llama-shaped sprinkles?" Liam asked hopefully.

"We'll see about the sprinkles," Mama said with a wink.

After a speedy breakfast, they were finally on their way. The car journey was filled with Liam's excited chatter about all the llamas he expected to see.

"Do you think they have baby llamas, Mama?" he asked, fidgeting in his seat.

"They probably do," Mama replied. "And maybe some llamas with fluffy wool, and maybe some that are even good at jumping!"

"Wow!" exclaimed Liam. "I hope they have a llama that's good at jumping! I want to see it jump over a little fence."

Finally, they arrived at the llama farm. Liam gasped. It was even better than he had imagined! There were llamas of all shapes and sizes, some with fluffy wool, some with sleek coats, and some even wearing silly hats!

"Whoa!" he breathed, staring wide-eyed at the animals.

"Come on, Liam, let's go meet the llamas," Mama said, taking his hand.

They walked into a large pen, where several llamas were munching on hay. One particularly large llama, with a very impressive amount of fluffy wool, turned its head and blinked slowly at them.

"Hello there!" Liam said softly. He approached the llama cautiously, holding out his hand. "My name is Liam, and I love llamas."

The llama seemed to consider this. It sniffed Liam's hand gently, then nudged him with its nose. Liam giggled.

"Mama, look! He likes me!"

"He certainly does," Mama said, smiling. "He seems like a very friendly llama."

They spent a happy hour wandering around the pen, admiring the llamas. Liam learned that llamas come in different colours, from creamy white to chocolate brown and even a speckled grey. He learned that they like to eat hay and that they sometimes make a funny humming sound when they're happy.

Suddenly, a little girl with pigtails came running over. "Excuse me," she said shyly, "Do you know where the jumping llamas are?"

"Jumping llamas?" Liam asked excitedly. "I want to see those!"

"They're over there," said the little girl, pointing to a smaller pen at the end of the field. "They're having a jumping contest."

Liam's eyes widened. "Come on, Mama! Let's go!" He grabbed her hand and ran towards the jumping pen.

The jumping pen was surrounded by a crowd of people. In the middle, a llama with a determined look on its face was standing near a low fence. A woman with a microphone was speaking.

"Alright, folks! Here we have 'Lightning' about to attempt to clear his final jump! Ready, Lightning?"

The llama, Lightning, looked directly at the fence, took a short run, and leaped gracefully over it! The crowd cheered.

"Wow!" Liam gasped. "Did you see that, Mama? He jumped so high!"

They watched as other llamas took their turns, some clearing the jumps and some, to Liam’s delight, tripping a little over the hurdles. He was so fascinated by the process that he did not notice when he wandered away from his mother.

Liam explored the area near the jumping arena when he came across a rather timid looking llama with one ear folded. This llama was standing all by itself. The animal was not as sleek or magnificent looking as Lightning but, Liam thought the Llama's coat held a unique beauty.

Liam noticed that it was alone and didn't seem very keen on what was happening around it. He walked closer and said hello, trying to use a gentle tone of voice. The Llama turned and lowered its head slightly, then began to rub its ear on the ground.

"Hello," Liam repeated. "Are you feeling alright?" He didn't think the Llama was responding because, as he watched and observed the Llama more closely, he began to realise there was something wrong.

"Mama?" he called softly, looking around. The Llama seemed agitated now, stamping its feet slightly, looking confused and distressed. Liam was still looking around for his mother when a strange series of bleating and neighing sounds started up in the nearby pens. Liam froze.

"That doesn't sound right, does it?"

"No," replied a voice. Liam span around, expecting to see his Mama. Instead he found the girl with pigtails standing behind him. She looked quite worried, just like him.

"The animals!" she gasped. "They're distressed, and no one is doing anything. We need to get help."

Liam knew that this wasn't right. He also realised that in all his excitement, he was a little bit away from his mother. He needed to find Mama and tell her what was happening!

"Where is help?" he asked. The girl shrugged.

"I don't know, but this way is towards the entrance, and maybe we can alert someone!" she stated as she started moving. Liam was reluctant to leave the troubled looking Llama.

"Wait!" he suddenly said. "What about the llamas?"

The girl considered his comment for a moment and seemed a little unsure of what to do.

"Quick," Liam said to her "There must be someone around who knows what's happening." They ran back towards the main pens. All the Llamas seemed confused and distressed by the commotion.

"Oh my," Liam suddenly called out. "This looks really bad. Is this what happened with all those bleating sounds?" The girl nodded her head. Liam suddenly pointed to an area across the farmyard.

"Over there! I think that must be the farmer! Follow me!"

The girl with the pigtails, whose name was now revealed to be Sophie, and Liam darted across the yard. As they were moving towards the entrance to the farm, they were delighted to see Liam’s Mama looking for them.

"Liam! Oh thank goodness you are safe! I was so worried! And you, too, young lady," Mama turned to Sophie, and gave her a big hug.

Liam pointed to where the distressed animals were standing.

"Mama, we think something is wrong, and they are not doing well."

Sophie added, "Yes, all the llamas sound and look confused. I heard noises. It made them start behaving strangely."

"Something definitely must be wrong. What did you both hear?" asked Liam's Mama. She had grown concerned.

"Mama, you know that llama, 'Lightning?'" Liam asked, "He was trying to jump when all the animals started bleating! The bleating and the noises did not sound good. "We looked at one of the Llama's who was feeling lonely, but he was also distressed" Sophie confirmed.

Liam and Sophie watched, along with Liam's Mama, as a farmer quickly ushered some assistants out to the main enclosures. He was examining the distressed animals.

"I'm worried something's happened in the water supply," the farmer said as he approached. "Perhaps a leak that has contaminated it. We’re already working on the cause of the problem, and we should resolve it shortly."

Liam turned to Sophie. "I'm so glad you know what's going on! It looked terrible, the way the Llama’s were looking."

The farm owners were incredibly grateful for the duo's help and they went and helped each other find Lightning, to ensure he was alright.

Eventually, order was restored, and everyone relaxed, knowing that the Llamas were feeling better. Liam enjoyed many more fun moments in the farm that day, making more new friends. It had been a busy, exciting and ultimately helpful day at the Llama Lollapalooza!

Liam was absolutely thrilled that he and Sophie had helped to solve a real problem, and he could not wait to tell his father about it all when he got home. They returned to the Jumping Arena. Liam felt grateful for all the Llamas on the farm.
