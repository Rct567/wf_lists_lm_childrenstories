<title>Ruby's Red Robe and the Rainbow</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled beside a sparkling blue river, lived a little girl named Ruby. Ruby loved the color red. Everything she owned was red – her shoes, her hair ribbons, even her tiny toy car. But Ruby’s most prized possession was a beautiful, soft, red robe. It was as red as a juicy cherry, as fluffy as a summer cloud, and as warm as a cozy fireplace.

Ruby wore her red robe every day. She wore it when she went outside to play in the sunny meadow, she wore it when she helped her mother bake yummy apple pies, and she even wore it when she went to bed. Her red robe made her feel happy and brave.

One morning, Ruby woke up to a very gray day. The sky was covered in thick, heavy clouds, and the rain was pattering softly against her window. Ruby was a little bit sad. She loved the sun and the blue sky, and she missed playing outside. She put on her red robe to cheer herself up.

"Don't worry, Ruby," her mother said, smiling. "The sun will peek through those clouds eventually. Why don't you read a book by the window while we wait?"

Ruby nodded and went to sit by the window. She loved to read, especially books about faraway lands and exciting adventures. She curled up in her red robe and started to read a story about a brave princess and a magical dragon.

As she read, the rain began to fall harder. The raindrops danced on the windowpane, making it hard to see outside. Suddenly, the sky brightened a little. Ruby looked up from her book, curious. The clouds were beginning to part! And then, she saw it.

A magnificent rainbow! It stretched across the sky, a perfect arc of brilliant colors. Ruby gasped. She had never seen a rainbow so close before. It seemed to arch right over her village.

"Mama! Papa! Come look!" Ruby shouted, her voice filled with excitement.

Her parents hurried into the room, and they both stared in amazement at the rainbow. "Oh, Ruby," her mother said, "it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!"

Ruby felt so happy. The gray day didn't seem so gloomy anymore. She ran outside, her red robe flowing behind her. She wanted to see the rainbow up close.

As she ran, Ruby realized that the rainbow was even more amazing than she had imagined. It was like a giant, colorful bridge reaching from the earth all the way up to the sky. The colors were so vibrant and clear – a brilliant red, a warm orange, a sunny yellow, a leafy green, a calming blue, a deep indigo, and a cheerful violet.

Ruby walked and walked, following the path of the rainbow. She felt like she was walking into a magical world. She passed by the big oak tree at the edge of the meadow, and the little babbling brook that always sang a happy song. Everything seemed brighter and more colorful than usual.

As she continued her adventure, Ruby noticed something else. The raindrops were still falling, but they were different. They sparkled and shimmered, and when they touched her red robe, they left little dots of every color in the rainbow. Ruby twirled around, watching the colorful rain decorate her robe.

She felt as though the rainbow itself was painting her red robe with all the colours of the world. Each color brought her a different feeling - red, like the passion in her heart for fun and adventure, orange that made her feel energetic and bubbly, and yellow, that sparked feelings of true happiness and light, just like the sun. Green gave her feelings of contentment, just like sitting in the tall blades of grass in the summer sun, Blue made her feel tranquil, like the calming waters of the lake near her village, indigo that brought feelings of knowing and wisdom, and finally, violet which brought forth feelings of artistic flare and elegance. Ruby knew that these colours would fill her with more happiness than she thought possible.

She skipped along and saw that, as she travelled, a tiny blue bird landed on her shoulder. She had to move incredibly slowly, so she did not frighten it away. It was a beautiful blue bird and looked just like the colour blue within the rainbow. The bird looked into her eyes with its tiny, black pupils and let out a beautiful song of peace and tranquillity. Ruby listened carefully and made sure that she paid attention to the music. She had never experienced anything like this before.

Finally, Ruby reached the end of the rainbow. Or, at least, what looked like the end. It seemed to touch the ground on the other side of the sparkling blue river. When she got closer, she saw that there was a beautiful, small cottage at the end of the rainbow. The cottage was made of all the colours of the rainbow too – the roof was red, the door was orange, the windows were yellow, the walls were green and blue, and the chimney was violet.

Ruby was very curious. She had never seen a cottage like it before. With her red robe still speckled with the colorful rain, she slowly approached the cottage.

As she got closer, the door creaked open, and a friendly old woman with sparkling eyes and a rainbow-colored shawl appeared. "Welcome, little Ruby," she said, smiling. "I've been expecting you."

Ruby was surprised. "How did you know my name?" she asked.

The old woman chuckled. "I know many things, little one. This is the Rainbow Cottage. It's where all the colors of the rainbow live."

Ruby's eyes widened. "Really?"

"Yes," the old woman said. "Each color has its own room in the cottage. Would you like to see?"

Ruby nodded excitedly. She followed the old woman inside the Rainbow Cottage. The cottage was even more magical on the inside. The rooms were filled with colorful light, and everything was sparkling and shimmering.

The first room they went into was the Red Room. It was warm and cozy, with red curtains, a red rug, and a red rocking chair. Ruby felt a rush of happiness and bravery when she entered this room. She was reminded of all the amazing times she had experienced.

Next, they went into the Orange Room. This room was bright and bubbly, with orange cushions, orange candles, and orange artwork. Ruby felt cheerful and playful here.

Then, they went into the Yellow Room. This room was filled with sunlight, with yellow flowers in vases, and yellow cushions. Ruby felt joyful and full of light in this room.

Next, they went into the Green Room. This room was tranquil, with green plants, a green table and a green book. Ruby felt content and peaceful.

Then, they went into the Blue Room. This room was calming and peaceful, with blue paintings and a blue bed. Ruby felt at ease.

Next, they went into the Indigo Room. This room was filled with things that encouraged thinking and knowledge. She saw a book there about all of the stars and planets in the universe. Ruby had always wanted to know about what was out there!

Finally, they went into the Violet Room. This room was full of lovely purple paints and art and music, and Ruby loved this room of creativity. She could let her ideas flow and be completely original.

As Ruby explored each room, she realised that each color made her feel a certain way. Each color added to who she was and who she wanted to be.

After they had visited all of the rooms, the old woman smiled at Ruby. "Do you like the Rainbow Cottage, Ruby?"

"It's amazing!" Ruby exclaimed. "Thank you for showing it to me!"

"You're welcome, little one," the old woman said. "You are a special girl, and your red robe is very special, too."

Ruby smiled, and in that moment, her red robe felt the warmest it had ever felt.

"You see," the old woman explained. "Each color represents a feeling. And when you experience all of the colors together, like the rainbow, you feel complete. Your red robe has been on a long journey. You carry all of the emotions within you that everyone carries! All of them make you, well, you."

Then, the rain outside started to fade, and the sun began to peek through the clouds again. The rainbow, which had been its brightest when she was at the cottage, started to fade away as well. It looked a little more distant, and the beautiful colours, while still visible, were not as eye-catching.

"It's time for you to go home now, Ruby," the old woman said. "But remember, the rainbow is always there, even when you can't see it. And so are all the colors and feelings within you."

Ruby hugged the old woman tightly. "Thank you for everything," she said.

Ruby said goodbye and left the Rainbow Cottage, stepping back into the bright, sunny day. She knew that her red robe would never be the same, it was now covered in a variety of different feelings and it was all thanks to a beautiful journey with a wonderful rainbow. As she walked back to her village, the sun shone brightly and brought a gentle feeling of joy to Ruby's heart. She smiled, looking back to where the cottage stood - now, just a simple cottage by the edge of the river - she knew that she'd always carry the memories of the rainbow, and the feelings of each colour, with her. She knew that the red robe that was always there to comfort her, would keep her warm for her adventures.
And as the day turned into evening, with the sun setting behind the big oak tree, Ruby curled up in her red robe. It had never felt so soft, so warm, and so full of colors. She felt happy and complete, just like a rainbow. And she knew that she would never forget her magical adventure and all of the feelings that the rainbow showed her. She dreamt of more amazing journeys in her dreams that night, knowing she'd forever be thankful for her red robe, and her journey across the rainbow.

The End.
