<title>Benjamin's Boat Ride on the Lake</title><body>
Once upon a time, nestled between a giggle of green hills and a splash of a shimmering lake, lived a small, slightly clumsy, but very enthusiastic boy named Benjamin. Benjamin loved adventures. His biggest adventure of all? Well, that involved a rather rickety, second-hand, and rather purple boat he'd affectionately named "The Bubblegum Buster."

The Bubblegum Buster wasn't exactly known for its speed. In fact, it was known more for its ability to wobble precariously and its unfortunate tendency to leak when faced with more than a thimbleful of water. Still, to Benjamin, it was a magnificent vessel, a floating castle of pure possibility!

One bright and breezy Tuesday (a Tuesday, mind you, that also happened to be the day before Wednesday – a detail Benjamin deemed supremely important), Benjamin decided it was time for a proper boat ride. He’d packed a picnic consisting of a triple-decker peanut butter and jam sandwich, a bag of extra-salty crisps, and a half-eaten carrot which he planned to share with the lake’s legendary, and entirely fictional, goldfish, Captain Flipperfin.

Before he could set sail, however, Benjamin had to perform a crucial pre-boat-ride ritual. First, he had to don his Captain's Hat (a slightly squashed and rather smelly bucket he’d 'borrowed' from the garden shed), then, he had to salute the boat at least three times. This was followed by a very serious inspection of his life jacket, which, truth be told, was a little too big and often rode up around his ears.

“Alright, Bubblegum Buster, prepare for action!” he declared, his voice cracking with excitement.

He wrestled the Bubblegum Buster from its mooring, which involved a great deal of grunting and pulling. Finally, with a satisfying *thwack*, the boat came free and wobbled into the water. Benjamin, clutching his Captain's Hat, climbed aboard. The boat immediately began to list to one side.

“Steady as she goes, Bubblegum Buster! Steady!” Benjamin shouted, frantically trying to regain his balance.

He fumbled with the oars, which were mismatched and painted with different colours (one was blue, one was green), and began to row. The Bubblegum Buster, however, seemed to have a mind of its own. It decided to go in circles.

"Left, Bubblegum Buster! Left!" Benjamin instructed, rowing furiously on the right.

Instead, the boat spun even faster. He was soon dizzy, the sky seemed to spin, and the lake began to resemble a swirling pool of peppermint candy.

“Whoa there!” he cried, grabbing for the peanut butter and jam sandwich to steady himself. This, unfortunately, tipped the scales in the boat’s wobbliness and the boat began to tilt further, and further...

Suddenly, *sploosh*! The half-eaten carrot leaped out of his hand, landing with a pathetic *thud* in the water. It was going to be a long journey for Captain Flipperfin. Benjamin, however, felt the distinct sensation of water creeping up his boots. The Bubblegum Buster was definitely leaking.

“Oh, bother!” he muttered, bailing out water with a very small, and mostly useless, plastic cup.

As he bailed, he realized he was heading straight for Old Man Fitzwilliam’s prize-winning duck pond. Old Man Fitzwilliam was known throughout the village for his grumpy demeanour and his fierce protection of his ducks, who were called things like Horace, Mildred, and Reginald, and whom he considered his finest friends. Benjamin, therefore, was definitely not keen on crashing the Bubblegum Buster into the duck pond.

He rowed frantically, managing to steer the boat, ever so slightly, to the left, missing the pond. Just!

Unfortunately, this caused him to bump directly into a small, extremely annoyed frog sunbathing on a lily pad. The frog, startled, leaped into the air with a loud “Ribbit!” and landed…right in Benjamin's peanut butter and jam sandwich!

Benjamin stared at the frog, who was now attempting to wriggle its way out of a layer of sticky sandwich. The crisps he’d kept aside for later, flew into the air and splashed into the water, instantly softening. The sky rumbled a laugh. Benjamin could swear it was the rain teasing him, the little rascal.

The peanut butter and jam sandwich, with a disgruntled frog clinging to it, sank, along with the crisps, leaving a shimmering oily trail.

"Oh, dear," Benjamin sighed. The excitement was now replaced with soggy disappointment and a slight hunger pang.

Suddenly, he heard a loud “QUACK!”

He looked up. It was Horace. Horace, followed by Mildred and Reginald, swam towards the Bubblegum Buster. Old Man Fitzwilliam was nowhere to be seen. He realized the prize-winning ducks weren't quite as guarded as Benjamin thought.

Horace, the bravest of the ducks, hopped onto the Bubblegum Buster, pecked at Benjamin's Captain's Hat and looked at him with a curious glint in his beady eye. Mildred and Reginald followed, making themselves comfortable on the wobbling, and ever-leaking, deck of the Bubblegum Buster.

Benjamin giggled, completely forgetting his woes. "Hello, Horace! Hello, Mildred! Hello, Reginald!" he said.

Horace seemed to nod in greeting.

They sailed, if you could call it sailing, past a grumpy-looking swan who glared at them, a school of fish who darted away in a flash, and a friendly heron who stood gracefully on one leg, watching Benjamin and the ducks with amusement.

The Bubblegum Buster continued to leak, of course, but somehow, with the ducks onboard, and Benjamin's enthusiasm, it seemed to be floating just a little better.

He sailed on. Eventually, his tiny boat reached the far side of the lake. The sky began to turn from a bright sunny blue into the colours of a painting by the rainbow; the lake began to gently ripple with an amazing evening glow. Benjamin turned the Bubblegum Buster around, hoping to return before dark. The return journey was just as wobbly, but it didn’t matter. He'd spent the day sailing on the Bubblegum Buster with Horace, Mildred and Reginald, who had provided excellent company, all whilst being rained upon in the process. What could have been better?

Suddenly, as they neared the shore, disaster struck! Or at least, it looked like disaster.

The Bubblegum Buster hit something with a *thump*. It shuddered violently. Benjamin clutched the oars, his heart in his throat. He had run aground! Or worse.

He peered over the side, ready to face the worst. Perhaps a grumpy turtle had surfaced? A giant, hungry pike? He'd run into a submerged tree branch?

But what he saw made him burst out laughing.

He'd run aground…on the half-eaten carrot! Which had miraculously stayed afloat, carried by the wind and water currents and, it seemed, by the ducks as well. The frog? He had found new friends; he was last seen hopping off the submerged end and climbing a submerged root, probably to look for crisps.

The ducks all gave a communal *QUACK!* and paddled onto the shore as soon as they were able. As soon as the boat hit the sand, they waddled up, pecking the ground in what Benjamin imagined were friendly goodbyes. Benjamin grinned.

He waded out of the boat, carrying his deflated picnic bag.

Then, Benjamin gave the Bubblegum Buster one final salute, gathered himself, and pulled the Bubblegum Buster up on the shore.

His boat adventure hadn't gone according to plan, far from it. He'd had an uninvited guest, leaky vessel, and a peanut-butter-smeared mess to deal with, but it was the best adventure of his life, maybe, apart from tomorrow. It made him so very happy, perhaps happier than the day he discovered peanut butter. He trudged happily, even with the chilly lake water seeping into his boots, knowing tomorrow he could clean up and he would come back to the lake, the lake, the very fun lake, to enjoy another grand, clumsy adventure. He just might need a different boat and, perhaps, better packed crisps.
