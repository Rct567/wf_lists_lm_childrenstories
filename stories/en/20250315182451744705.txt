<title>Learning About the Importance of Sharing Our Colorful Crayons Together</title>
<body>
Lily loved crayons more than anything in the whole wide world. She had a giant, rainbow-colored box overflowing with every shade imaginable. There were shimmering silver crayons, glittery gold ones, and crayons that smelled like strawberries and blueberry muffins. Lily guarded her crayons fiercely. She never let anyone, not even her best friend, Leo, touch them.

Leo understood. He had a small collection of crayons too, but his box was plain and held only the basic colors: red, blue, yellow, green, and a few browns. Sometimes, when they sat together at the big oak table in Lily's backyard, Leo would sneak glances at Lily's vibrant collection, his own crayons looking dull and tired in comparison.

One sunny afternoon, they were drawing pictures of the ocean. Leo used his blue crayon to color the water, and Lily was using a turquoise crayon from her special box. The turquoise was so bright and sparkly; it looked like real ocean water shimmering in the sunlight.

"Wow, Lily," Leo said, admiring her picture. "Your ocean looks amazing!"

Lily puffed out her chest a little. "I know," she said, carefully coloring in a seagull with a sky-blue crayon.

Leo looked at his own picture, and then back at hers. His ocean seemed flat and boring compared to hers. He sighed, feeling a tiny pang of envy.

"Can I… can I borrow your turquoise crayon, just for a little bit?" Leo asked shyly.

Lily clutched her crayon box protectively. "No," she said quickly, her voice a little too loud. "These are my crayons."

Leo's face fell. He looked down at his drawing, his shoulders slumping. He knew Lily didn't like sharing, but it still made him feel sad. "Okay," he mumbled, returning to his plain blue ocean.

Lily continued coloring, her heart feeling a little bit tight. She knew she could have shared the turquoise crayon. It wouldn't have hurt her. But she didn't. She just kept coloring her perfect ocean scene, enjoying the vibrant colours only she had access to.

The next day, the weather took a turn for the worse. Dark grey clouds filled the sky, and a gentle drizzle turned into a heavy downpour. Leo wasn't able to come over to Lily’s house, as the roads became flooded. Lily found herself inside, staring out her window, feeling surprisingly lonely. She missed Leo. She knew they were supposed to work on their seashell collection together today.

As the rain fell, Lily’s mom came inside with a worried look on her face. “Oh, Lily, I have terrible news. The creek behind the town overflowed with all the rain, and lots of houses got damaged. They are asking for families in our area to provide aid or at least provide some spare things to people.”

Lily gasped, picturing all the water in her yard from just a while ago. That wasn’t as bad as the creek overflowing. Then Lily had another thought. “Is Leo alright?” she asked her mom, immediately worried for her best friend.

Her mom smiled, giving Lily a gentle hug. “He is okay, darling. But the worst thing is, they lost nearly everything. Leo's family doesn't have very many things anymore. I know that is the most upsetting thing for them.”

Lily was quiet for a moment, absorbing what her mom had said. Then, a thought struck her, and she quickly ran upstairs to her room, opening her giant crayon box. She looked at each individual crayon, remembering all the amazing pictures she created with it, remembering that she even denied Leo using the turquoise color from just a little bit earlier.

She took a deep breath and made a very big decision. Taking the whole box in her arms, she ran downstairs and said to her mother, “Mom, I want to do my best to help. We have some clothes and blankets that we can donate, but I know that I have something really special, and Leo really liked to draw. What can I do with them?”

Her mother’s eyes softened with warmth. "That's a wonderful idea, sweetie," her mom said, a big smile appearing on her face. “We'll take the crayons and add it to the donations.”

Lily held her crayon box tightly as her mother drove them to the community center. The scene was unlike anything Lily had ever seen before. There were people huddled together, wet and looking distraught. Blankets covered shivering children, and adults were sorting through boxes of clothes and food.

Lily found Leo and his family sitting near a large table filled with donated items. Leo looked small and sad, his usual sparkle dimmed. He clutched a muddy stuffed animal. Lily’s heart ached for him.

As her mother began unloading the donations, Lily walked over to Leo. He looked up at her, his eyes widening in surprise.

"Lily!" he said, his voice barely a whisper.

Lily held out her crayon box. "Leo," she said softly. "I... I brought these for you."

Leo stared at the box, his mouth agape. He knew how much Lily loved her crayons, and he could hardly believe that she was offering to give them to him. The turquoise crayon she used that made the waves looked just like water and sand - the whole set could draw any object in the sea. He hesitated for a moment, not wanting to take such a valuable thing away from his friend.

"But… your crayons…" Leo began.

"They're yours now," Lily said, her voice trembling slightly. "I want you to have them. I want you to draw something beautiful to cheer you up, when you need it the most."

Leo took the crayon box, carefully opening it. His eyes widened as he saw the rows of brilliant colors, all neatly arranged. The shimmering silver, the glittery gold, and the strawberry-scented crayons. A huge grin spread across his face.

"Wow, Lily! This is… this is the best thing ever!" Leo exclaimed, his sadness momentarily forgotten.

Lily felt a warmth spread through her, a feeling much brighter and more colourful than any of her crayons. Seeing Leo's face light up made her heart sing.

"We can share them," Lily said. "We can draw together!"

And that's exactly what they did. They sat side-by-side, sharing the crayons and drawing pictures to cheer up all the kids at the center. They drew brightly colored houses, smiling suns, and rainbow-filled skies, covering their pages with colours that symbolized the joy and hope they wanted the others to feel. Lily felt as if her heart, too, could join them and paint a beautiful, colourful story for the world.

Other kids began to join in, using crayons to decorate paper suns, smiling hearts and big, friendly monsters. Everyone was cheering as the colorful drawings hung on the community center’s wall.

Leo and Lily discovered that using crayons, and sharing them with others, was an even better feeling than hoarding them all for themselves. The act of helping other families in the community gave the community the spirit to heal and grow from this situation, as if these crayons represented them joining together.

Lily realized something important that day. Sharing wasn't about giving something away; it was about making someone else happy, and in doing so, making yourself happy too. When she had only focused on the crayon collection that was just for her, all the brilliant colours seemed very dull. With a wider group of people to give them to, she realised, each colour got brighter. And besides, these crayon creations now were now something real to all those that she cared for. They would go back home with a picture, feeling just a little bit of happiness.

From that day on, Lily continued to love her crayons, but she was never selfish with them again. She understood the importance of friendship, kindness, and, most importantly, sharing. She learned that the brightest colors of all came not from her crayon box, but from the warmth of her heart. She realized that true beauty lies not in what we keep, but in what we give. She and Leo would spend countless afternoons, and all their other friends, all drawing, laughing, and making colorful worlds together.
