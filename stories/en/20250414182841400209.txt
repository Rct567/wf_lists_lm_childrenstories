<title>A Present for Princess Penny</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in the land of Gigglebottom, lived a princess named Penny. Princess Penny wasn’t like other princesses. She didn’t care for tiaras, or fancy dresses, or even polite conversation. Oh no! Princess Penny loved silly jokes, especially the ones involving custard pies and rubber chickens. She also had a rather unfortunate habit of burping loudly, which, surprisingly, the royal court found endearing.

It was Princess Penny’s birthday, and the kingdom of Gigglebottom was buzzing with excitement. All sorts of peculiar gifts were being prepared for the princess. The royal baker, Bartholomew Buns, had baked a cake that resembled a giant, wobbly jelly, complete with dancing gummy bears on top. The court jester, a floppy-shoed fellow named Jingle, was practicing a juggling act with actual live sausages. (It didn’t always go according to plan.)

The preparations were grand, but the most important person in all of Gigglebottom – Princess Penny herself – wasn't concerned about the presents. She was busy trying to teach her pet dragon, Sparky, to do the chicken dance. Sparky, however, was more interested in roasting marshmallows over the royal fireplace, which, admittedly, was a much more delicious pursuit.

First, the King, Penny's father, presented his gift. He'd had it especially crafted by the royal tailor. It was a giant, bright purple pair of trousers with pockets big enough to hold a whole flock of pigeons (should one desire to keep a flock of pigeons in their trousers, of course). The trousers, alas, were slightly too big, and whenever the King took a step, they'd billow out, making a "Whoosh!" sound that made Penny giggle uncontrollably. "Thank you, Papa," she managed to say between fits of laughter, wiping a tear from her eye. "They're... splendid!"

Next came the Queen. The Queen, being ever so practical, had commissioned a special contraption from the royal inventor. It was a self-stirring porridge pot that could also sing operatic arias while it cooked. Unfortunately, during the unveiling, the porridge pot, overcome with performance anxiety, decided to belt out its operatic solo before the porridge was properly cooked, resulting in a shower of lumpy oatmeal that covered everyone within a ten-foot radius. Princess Penny, however, thought it was the funniest thing she'd ever seen and promptly began to sing along, off-key but with tremendous enthusiasm.

Then came the gift from the Duke of Diddledoo. He was known for his rather odd gifts. This year, he presented Penny with a self-inflating whoopee cushion that played the trumpet every time someone sat on it. (The Duke had an odd sense of humour). The whoopee cushion made an almighty "Brrrrrrump!" that sent the court guards flying and Sparky the dragon into a fit of giggles. Even the King couldn't help but crack a smile, despite the disruption it caused to the festivities.

Bartholomew Buns, the baker, nervously presented the jelly cake with the dancing gummy bears. The cake jiggled precariously as Bartholomew carried it, and when he set it down, one of the gummy bears, having lost its balance, tumbled off and landed squarely on the Duke of Diddledoo’s toupee, sticking it firmly to his head.

The jester, Jingle, had his moment. He began juggling his sausages with his signature brand of chaotic skill. He managed to keep five sausages in the air, then six, and then… disaster. One sausage flew off, landing directly in the Queen’s tea cup. Another smacked the King in the face, leaving a greasy smudge. But the remaining sausages, surprisingly, formed a perfect, rotating circle, making everyone erupt in applause and laughter, the queen even forgot all about her tea.

Penny thought it was all brilliantly funny, she felt so full of joy she was ready to do a backflip!

Suddenly, a very official-looking knight stepped forward. "By order of the Royal Society of Tickle Fighters," he announced in a booming voice, "we present Princess Penny with the most magnificent gift of all: a lifetime supply of giant, inflatable bananas!"

The court gasped. Giant, inflatable bananas? But why?

The knight explained that the Royal Society of Tickle Fighters believed that nothing could spark more joy than a perfectly timed, inflatable banana attack. And they were right.

Suddenly, a swarm of knights rolled in crates full of the colossal fruit. They took one giant banana and placed it directly in front of Penny and asked her if she was ready.

“READY!” she screamed.

At a single hand signal from the knight, the inflatable bananas were activated. Within seconds, Gigglebottom’s grand ballroom was transformed into a sea of bouncing, yellow joy. The knights, the jester, even the King and Queen – everyone was dodging, laughing, and swatting at the giant bananas. The jelly cake wobbled dangerously as it got swept from side to side. The gummy bears danced to the rhythm of bouncing bananas, and the sausage juggling had been all but forgotten as everybody joined in on the hilarious festivities.

Princess Penny, completely overcome with mirth, had barely escaped the rogue bananas when the air was full with giggles. Sparky, her dragon friend, also found great joy in chasing the giant, wobbly inflatables, trying to take a bite out of one with his little, but ferocious teeth, until one bounced into his mouth.

And then, another gift arrived. It wasn’t presented, but fell through the ballroom’s great chandelier, hitting the floor directly where Penny and Sparky stood! They both flinched and prepared to meet an unknown demise, but out of the rubble, a large figure stood.

The figure, covered in glittering dust and fragments of the smashed chandelier, cleared its throat. It was Barnaby, Penny’s best friend and the royal stable boy. He was known for being rather clumsy, but today he appeared nervous! “I… I wasn’t going to give this to you now.” Barnaby stammered.

Barnaby hadn’t forgotten Penny’s birthday! As the day’s gift giving had commenced, he’d been on the rooftop looking for the perfect way to reveal the greatest gift of all, not caring that it meant the chandelier's demise! But now, everything had gone completely haywire. With the knights’ bananas and his own clumsiness adding to the general chaos, all hope was lost for his grand entrance!

He held out his hand, which revealed a small box. The box was plain, undecorated, and small, which contrasted all of the grandness the earlier presents offered. Barnaby opened the box and revealed a tiny, beautifully crafted, handcrafted music box shaped like a rubber chicken, “Happy birthday Penny!” he said in a voice much like a timid field mouse, while showing Penny the beautiful miniature gift.

He started to turn the handle on the box, and a tinkling, slightly out-of-tune melody filled the ballroom, and the figure of Penny looked and the laughter paused, and everyone found a moment of wonder for themselves, and then a single tear of absolute happiness welled up from Penny’s eye. It was a song she could play with herself in her bedroom and she loved the tiny music box very much.

It wasn’t loud, it wasn’t spectacular, it wasn't even silly, but it was perfect. The simplicity of the gift made everyone quiet for just a moment, and the world spun that little bit slower. Penny hugged Barnaby tightly.

Even the Queen, usually composed, let out a happy sniffle. Even the King shed a tiny tear. Everyone, even the sausage-slinging Jester, seemed to recognize that, though laughter and silliness had their place, a gift from the heart, however small, was the greatest treasure of all.

After the melody, Barnaby put away the box for Penny.

As the party wound down, with the inflatable bananas slowly deflating, Penny gathered the other gifts: the giant trousers (which Sparky had decided to use as a temporary bed), the porridge pot (now singing a slightly melancholic aria), the self-inflating whoopee cushion, the deflated bananas (still being enthusiastically batted around), and the tiny rubber chicken music box.

Penny then went off with Sparky in the great ballroom.

She sat at the top of the table, with all the best snacks, cakes, and sausages surrounding them and took a deep, calming breath, ready to say goodnight. Penny leaned towards Sparky and asked what she could name the giant bananas!

“Bubblegum! No, I’ll just stick to marshmallows” Penny declared as Sparky looked with her beady eyes and tilted her head in confusion.

“Goodbye my friend!” Penny called out to Sparky as she went to bed. Sparky sighed and laid herself down beside Penny, as the little chicken box let out one last song.

And so, Princess Penny’s birthday came to a close, not with a crown, or a grand ball, but with laughter, giant inflatable bananas, a rubber chicken music box, and a heart full of joy.
The End.
