<title>Alice and the Apple Orchard</title><body>
Once upon a time, nestled between rolling green hills and a babbling brook, lay an apple orchard unlike any other. It wasn't just the juicy, crimson-red apples that made it special; it was the magic that hummed beneath the soil, breathed through the leaves, and whispered on the breeze. This orchard was tended by an old woman named Granny Willow, who had twinkling eyes and a smile that could warm even the chilliest autumn day.

One sunny morning, a young girl named Alice, with hair the colour of sunshine and eyes like the summer sky, skipped through the wooden gate. She loved visiting Granny Willow's apple orchard. The aroma of sweet apples, cinnamon, and a hint of woodsmoke always filled her with a delightful sense of adventure.

"Good morning, Granny Willow!" Alice called, her voice as bright as the morning light.

Granny Willow, perched on a sturdy, wooden stool, was carefully examining the leaves of a particularly vibrant apple tree. She turned, her face crinkling into a warm smile. "Alice, my dear! Just in time! This year’s harvest promises to be the best yet. Tell me, what brings you to the orchard today?"

"I just wanted to see the apples!" Alice exclaimed, her gaze already darting towards the trees laden with fruit. "And maybe... just maybe... try one."

Granny Willow chuckled, her eyes twinkling. "Patience, child. Before you taste an apple, you must understand them. Come, let us walk."

And so, they began their journey through the orchard. As they strolled between the trees, Granny Willow told Alice tales of the apple trees – tales of bravery and friendship, of wisdom and kindness, all woven into the very fabric of the trees.

"See this tree, Alice?" Granny Willow said, pointing to a gnarled, old tree with apples that shimmered with a golden glow. "This is the Courage Apple tree. It only bears fruit for those who are brave, for those who face their fears head-on."

Alice gazed at the golden apples, her imagination sparking. She had always been a little shy, a little hesitant. The idea of facing her fears was both intriguing and a little bit scary.

They moved on to another tree, this one laden with shimmering green apples. “And this, my dear, is the Friend Apple tree. It gives its apples only to those who are kind and generous, who cherish their friends and share with others.”

Further down the path stood a tree covered in ruby-red apples, each one perfectly round and polished. "These are the Wisdom Apples, Alice," Granny Willow said softly. "They are the most precious of all. They appear for those who listen, who observe, and who seek knowledge."

Alice listened intently, captivated by each story. The apples weren't just fruit; they were symbols, lessons in disguise, offering a deeper understanding of the world.

As they reached the centre of the orchard, they came upon a tree unlike any Alice had seen before. It was a magnificent tree, its branches laden with apples of every colour imaginable – crimson, gold, green, yellow, even a swirling mixture of colours that resembled tiny galaxies. The apples pulsed with a soft, ethereal light.

"This," Granny Willow whispered, "is the Wishing Apple tree."

Alice gasped. "A wishing tree?"

Granny Willow nodded. "It grants wishes, but only to those with a pure heart, a strong belief, and a wish that benefits the world, not just themselves."

"Wow!" Alice exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder. "Can I... can I pick one?"

Granny Willow smiled gently. "You may try. But remember, the Wishing Apples are not easily earned. The tree will decide if your heart is ready."

Alice, her heart pounding with excitement, carefully reached out a hand. She chose an apple with a beautiful swirling mix of colours and gently plucked it from the branch. As she held it, a warm feeling spread through her, a sense of hope and anticipation.

"Now, close your eyes, Alice," Granny Willow instructed. "Hold the apple tightly, and whisper your wish."

Alice closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and thought about what she truly desired. She thought about all the kindness she could offer and how she could overcome her fear of public speaking. Finally, she whispered, “I wish for the confidence to help others and to not be so scared to speak up when things aren't right."

When Alice opened her eyes, the apple in her hand began to glow brighter, pulsating with the same light as before. A faint aroma of warm apple pie filled the air.

“Did it work, Granny Willow?” Alice asked, her voice filled with anticipation.

Granny Willow smiled knowingly. "Only time will tell, my dear. But the fact that the apple glows so brightly is a very good sign."

Alice carefully ate the magical apple, savoring the delicious flavour as she ate. It wasn't just tasty, it also left her feeling braver and a little bit kinder. Then, feeling adventurous, she wandered throughout the rest of the orchard.

She visited the Courage Apple tree and reached out her hand toward the golden fruit. The apples shimmered at her, welcoming. "It’s because you weren't afraid to try for a wish of your own," Granny Willow whispered to her. This time Alice didn't hesitate.

Alice found an apple for her closest friend, Ben. With him, they went on a mission to make their school the most welcoming and safest place for all. With some of the Wisdom apples she picked, they learned new lessons that guided their cause. 

Over the coming weeks and months, Alice's life began to change. She felt a new strength within her, a willingness to speak her mind and help others. At school, she volunteered to speak up about bullying in her classroom and to help organize the fundraiser she was always too shy to even think of participating in.

She noticed things she hadn't seen before - new kinds of smiles on people's faces and the happy energy of people helping people.

The magic of the Apple Orchard was subtly weaving itself into her world, slowly bringing about her wish. Alice had been kind and wise before, of course, but after eating the Wishing Apple, she realised the value of all of her abilities, of bravery and friendships. She felt confident with her role.

And as she grew older, Alice became a true champion of her friends, family, and community. She showed that even the smallest of wishes, if born from a pure heart, could blossom into something extraordinary. The apple orchard continued to flourish under the gentle care of Granny Willow and the gentle influence of Alice. The magic of the apples, passed down through the generations, would forever touch the lives of everyone who stepped within its wondrous walls.
And, every year, the apples would keep giving their magic away.
The end.
