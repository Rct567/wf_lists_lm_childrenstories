<title>Paddington's Big Birthday Surprise Party</title><body>Paddington Bear, the little bear from darkest Peru, was very excited. It was almost his birthday! He loved birthdays, especially when they involved marmalade sandwiches, which were his absolute favourite.

Paddington lived with the Brown family – Mr. and Mrs. Brown, Jonathan, and Judy – at number thirty-two Windsor Gardens. He had a bright blue duffel coat, a red hat, and a very kind heart. He also had a rather clumsy way about him, which often led to interesting adventures and, sometimes, a bit of a muddle.

This year, Paddington felt something was up. The Browns were being very secretive. They kept whispering in the kitchen and hiding things behind their backs. Mrs. Bird, the Browns’ housekeeper, was also behaving oddly, humming tunes and stirring big pots of something that smelled delicious, but Paddington wasn’t quite sure what.

One morning, Paddington was enjoying a large marmalade sandwich for breakfast. He sat at the table, carefully spreading marmalade on the bread when Mr. Brown called him into the living room.

"Paddington," Mr. Brown said with a slightly nervous smile, "We need you to do us a favour."

"A favour?" Paddington asked, crumbs of marmalade clinging to his whiskers. "Oh yes, Mr. Brown! I am very good at favours! What do you need?"

Mr. Brown explained that he and Mrs. Brown, Jonathan, and Judy needed to go out for the day to a special museum. He asked Paddington to stay at home, just for the day, and keep the house tidy. He emphasized "very tidy".

"And," Mrs. Brown added, "Mrs. Bird will be here to keep you company. You can have all the marmalade sandwiches you like, and perhaps you could water the plants, Paddington."

Paddington puffed out his chest. He loved watering the plants. “Of course! I shall do my very best! I will keep the house extremely tidy!” he declared. He felt very important.

The Browns left, and Mrs. Bird set about making a very large pot of tea. “Now Paddington,” she said, bustling around the kitchen, "Let's get started, shall we?"

Paddington set about his tasks with enthusiasm. First, he went to the kitchen to look at the plants. There was the geranium, the fern, and a small cactus. He carefully watered them all, humming to himself. He made sure the fern had plenty of water.

After the plants were taken care of, Paddington decided to start on the tidying. He started in the living room. He picked up the newspapers and carefully folded them. He stacked them neatly by the fireplace. Then, he decided to dust. He found a duster and began to wave it around. He dusted the furniture, the bookshelves, and even the lamps. He got a bit carried away, and a small cloud of dust filled the room. He sneezed, "Achoo!" and then carried on.

Next, he went to the kitchen. He washed the dishes, making sure there were no sneaky bits of marmalade hiding anywhere. He swept the floor and carefully wiped down the counters. He noticed a large bowl filled with what looked like little red apples. He picked one up.

"Those are crab apples, Paddington," Mrs. Bird said from the doorway. "They are for…something special later."

Paddington, being a very curious bear, didn't know about crab apples. He tasted it anyway, as it looked tasty!

"Ooh, that is sour!" Paddington declared, scrunching up his face.

Mrs. Bird chuckled. "They're not meant to be eaten raw, Paddington!"

After all the housework was done, Mrs. Bird made a pot of tea and gave Paddington some delicious buttered toast. He happily munched on the toast while he looked at the clock. The Browns had been gone for a long time! He was very eager for their return. He wanted to show them how tidy the house was!

Suddenly, he heard a noise. It was a very unusual noise – a "honk, honk" – coming from the back garden. He looked out the window. He saw a rather large red vehicle parked there, a van with colourful balloons tied on. A couple of children came running into the house and up to Paddington! Paddington, completely bewildered, could not work out what was going on.

“Is everything ready, Mrs. Bird?” they heard one of the children call out.

Paddington opened the back door and walked outside. He peeked his head into the garden. He saw lots of colourful things and lots of familiar faces! And all of the faces were smiling at him! Paddington blinked his eyes and quickly looked away and then back again.

Mr. and Mrs. Brown, Jonathan, and Judy came out of the van, smiling and laughing. They were carrying large parcels wrapped in bright paper. Behind them, came a whole group of Paddington's friends! There was Mr. Gruber from the antique shop, the kindly old gentleman; Mrs. Bird came out with an enormous cake. It had “Happy Birthday, Paddington!” written on it in bright icing.

"Surprise!" they all shouted, at the same time.

Paddington’s mouth dropped open. He couldn’t believe it. He'd never had a surprise party before!

"But...the tidying!" he exclaimed.

"It doesn't matter about the tidying, Paddington!" Mrs. Brown said, giving him a hug. "It's your birthday!"

Mr. Gruber approached, holding a beautifully wrapped parcel. “Happy Birthday, Paddington,” he said, “I hope you like your present.”

Paddington carefully opened the parcel. Inside was a special edition of his favourite book about explorers! He was delighted!

Soon, everyone was chatting and laughing. Jonathan and Judy showed Paddington the decorations – colourful streamers and balloons all around the garden. The red vehicle, the van with the balloons was full of food and drinks. Mr. Gruber presented Paddington with a specially made sandwich (with a little crab apple!)

They all sang "Happy Birthday" and Mrs. Bird cut the cake. Paddington had a huge piece, and even helped himself to a second one! It was delicious!

Paddington and the other children played party games, and even Mr. Brown joined in. The garden was filled with laughter and shouts of joy. Paddington was surrounded by friends and family and feeling very warm and full.

Then, it was time for presents. Paddington received all sorts of lovely things – a new blue duffel coat (just like his old one), a brand new marmalade jar, and a whole bag of marmalade sandwiches. He had an entire sandwich, even though he knew he'd already eaten a piece of the cake! He was very spoiled indeed.

The day went by in a whirl of happiness. Paddington had never been so happy in his life. When it started to get dark, it was time for everyone to go home.

Paddington, tired but happy, sat on a chair. He felt like he was going to burst from happiness and deliciousness!

“It was the best birthday ever!” he announced, happily munching on a marmalade sandwich.

The Browns and Mrs. Bird smiled at each other. They were glad they had planned the party. It had been a very long, very fun, but a very tiring day.

Mr. Brown smiled and said, “We’re so happy you liked it, Paddington. But now, I think you need to get some rest."

Paddington agreed.

As Paddington climbed into bed, he looked back at the day and he realised two things: he was lucky to be part of a lovely family, and that a party, full of friendship and love, was the perfect thing. He was very excited to go back into the kitchen and enjoy another marmalade sandwich for breakfast tomorrow.

He was exhausted, but still happy, as he closed his eyes. It was his perfect birthday party, and all because of his wonderful, kind, and loving family and friends.

"Goodnight, Paddington," whispered Mr. Brown.

"Goodnight, Mr. Brown," Paddington mumbled sleepily. And with one last happy thought, he drifted off to sleep. The best birthday ever! He couldn't wait to see what adventures tomorrow would bring.
