<title>A Secret Code of Kindness from the Kindest Dragon in History.</title><body>

Once upon a time, nestled in a valley brimming with sparkling waterfalls and lollipop trees, lived a dragon unlike any other. His name was Bartholomew, and he wasn't known for fire-breathing or hoarding gold. Bartholomew was famous for being the kindest dragon in all of history. His scales shimmered with the colours of a rainbow, and his eyes twinkled with pure, unadulterated joy. Instead of terrorizing villages, Bartholomew spent his days helping others. He'd use his enormous tail to clear fallen trees from pathways, his powerful wings to fan butterflies safely across stormy weather, and his gentle claws to harvest the sweetest berries for the children of the valley.

One sunny morning, as Bartholomew was busy sculpting a giant slide out of a mossy hill for the giggling bunnies, he noticed a small, scruffy girl sitting alone by a babbling brook. Her name was Lily, and she always wore a patched-up dress and had a smudge of dirt permanently etched on her cheek. Lily often seemed sad, and Bartholomew, with his kind heart, felt a pang of empathy.

He lumbered over, his steps making the earth tremble slightly. Lily jumped, startled, and scrambled back a little, her eyes wide with fear.

"Don't be frightened, little one," Bartholomew boomed in his gentle voice. "I'm Bartholomew. What troubles you?"

Lily hesitated, clutching a wilting dandelion in her hand. "It's…it's nothing, Mr. Dragon," she mumbled. "Just a bit lonely, I suppose."

Bartholomew lowered his head until his kind eyes met hers. "Loneliness is a heavy burden to carry," he said. "I have many friends who are always joyous. How can I help?"

Lily sighed. "People don't usually...well, they don't like to play with me. They say I'm… well, they say I'm a bit grubby and my clothes are torn.” Her voice dwindled into a whisper.

Bartholomew's heart ached for the little girl. He knew how important kindness was. “Nonsense,” he said, his voice filled with genuine warmth. “Kindness doesn't see dirt or torn clothes. It sees the beautiful heart within.”

He thought for a moment, stroking his chin thoughtfully with his claw. An idea sparked in his mind.

"Lily, I have an idea. We'll make a secret code! A code that unlocks the magic of kindness."

Lily's eyes widened with curiosity. "A secret code? How?"

"Every day, we'll perform a small act of kindness, and for each act, we'll remember a special phrase. Then, you write these words on a special, magical notepad that will also give you the tools for good works." Bartholomew chuckled, his rumbling laugh like distant thunder. "The first one? It starts now."

Bartholomew used a piece of his scale, shiny and iridescent, and wrote the words of the kindness code to show how each would look in action.

**The Secret Code of Kindness:**

*   **Sunrise Song**: "Help someone see the beauty around them." (e.g., Offer a comforting word, compliment, or share a view or a flower.)
*   **Cloud Hug**: "Offer assistance in difficult tasks" (e.g., carry some heavy books, help an older person reach something.)
*   **Moonbeam’s Wish**: "Show empathy and try to offer assistance when someone is feeling sad" (e.g. Visit someone or write a nice letter, giving words of encouragement.)
*   **Star Shower**: "Give a surprise or treat to brighten the day". (e.g. Give a small gift of treats.)
*   **Rainbow's Embrace**: "Include someone in the things you enjoy doing" (e.g. Play a game with others)

Bartholomew magically created a special notebook of pages filled with paper that had a golden sheen, and the ink magically appears for each task performed. Then he plucked some wild berries and offered one to Lily, and the ink appeared on the first page, and so he made a second page for Cloud Hug.

"Now, Lily," said Bartholomew, smiling, "Every day you do an act, you write in the special book of your deeds and how you have offered your assistance in a difficult task."

The next day, Lily, clutching her notebook and her berry. Remembering the 'Sunrise Song,' she spotted a small, shy boy named Thomas struggling to reach an apple from a tree. His face was creased in effort, but he was not tall enough, and so it was a struggle. “Let me help” she said gently. Offering the boy an apple of his own, she offered the boy a helping hand. Thomas had to laugh, and was so surprised that he offered her another, since she seemed like someone he would like to get to know better.

As they laughed together, enjoying the apple in each others company, the memory appeared on the page, and the words, *‘She offered an apple to the boy’* appeared in golden script, along with the first of the secret words for kindness: "Sunrise Song."

The second day, she went over to a woman with very heavy shopping. As she struggled home, with tears in her eyes and in obvious difficulties to manage, Lily ran over, and offered to help carry the baskets. The lady was ecstatic, and she praised her for helping. In her notebook the memory had appeared, in gold lettering *'Lily offered help, in a time of need.'*

As the weeks passed, Lily became a beacon of kindness in the valley. She wasn't just doing the acts for the code anymore. Her heart was genuinely filled with joy every time she helped someone. She helped Mrs. Gable’s garden when she realised it had gone unkept in a time of sadness. As Lily tended it, carefully using her gentle, helpful hands and feet, she discovered how a rainbow could make the sky shine and feel beautiful.

She shared her treats that were a gift of joy to the other children. Instead of just trying to get close, she learned the Moonbeam's wish, so as to build relationships, and make people truly happy with her offer.

The change in Lily was remarkable. Her clothes still might have had a patch or two, but now, laughter twinkled in her eyes, and she held her head high. Other children started to notice the good deeds she carried out. They saw the joy that blossomed from helping. They began to want to join in. Slowly but surely, the children also started doing kind things, learning Bartholomew’s Code, one step at a time.

Soon, the entire valley was filled with acts of kindness. The children organized a cleanup of the brook and volunteered to help the elderly with their errands. The little valley was blooming in beautiful sunshine and filled with smiles. It turned out that kindness was contagious. The kindness of the valley made people happy and friendly. Everyone wanted to know why.

The first time Thomas the boy that got the apple gave Lily a compliment, the words went onto the secret notebook. The boy and the girl continued to get along well.

Lily showed all the children how Bartholomew the dragon was her special friend and told them of the Secret Code. They came running.

Bartholomew was delighted by the transformation he'd witnessed. He continued to act for the valley. As he did so, a new item was on his magic to do list: teaching the children about responsibility.

One day, Bartholomew, who was also helping the valley, flew overhead as the valley’s residents took out their kindness deeds and offered kindness as the thing they would share. They shared food, and ideas.
Bartholomew descended from above the valley and smiled at everyone. The Secret Code of Kindness, was a success, in making all the children the best version of themselves. Bartholomew, in a very nice voice said, "You are kind! Your notebook will remind you to be responsible.” He created all the new words in another notebook.

**The Secret Code of Responsibility**

*   **Sunshine Share**: "Taking care of yourself and doing chores to make life easy" (e.g. Putting toys away or clearing plates after a meal.)
*   **Tidiness Treasure**: "Taking responsibility for others". (e.g. Helping clean up the things others might have messed up, or help pick the plants)
*   **Helpful Hand**: "Keeping your agreements by telling the truth" (e.g. If you promised to meet someone, and you missed them, say sorry and then visit the person. Keeping agreements, big or small, builds a strong character.)

With her journal of notes about kindness, and now, one for responsibility, Lily took another task for the people in the valley.

They became responsible, helpful, and filled with kindness in all of their tasks. The Valley flourished with beauty. The world was a place for joy, and the people had each other, for always and always.
Lily, was, and always would be, the most beloved little girl in the valley. And, from his mountaintop perch, Bartholomew the Kindest Dragon watched over them all, his rainbow scales shimmering, a smile dancing on his face, knowing that the secret code of kindness had not only transformed a single little girl, but an entire valley, forever filled with love and joy. He knew he could always help if they wanted to talk. His heart had never been so full of happiness.

And so, the kindest dragon lived happily ever after, knowing the impact of a single, good deed and the power of kindness, multiplied many times over, will echo on for the rest of the story.
