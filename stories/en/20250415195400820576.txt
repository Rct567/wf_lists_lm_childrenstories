<title>The Cloud Who Wanted to Rain</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, high above the world, lived a fluffy, white cloud named Nimbus. Nimbus wasn't like the other clouds. While they loved to drift lazily across the sky, casting fluffy shadows over fields and whispering secrets to the wind, Nimbus longed to do something more. He longed to rain.

He’d watch, with a great longing in his fluffy heart, as the other clouds would grow heavy, dark, and filled with water. He would hear the joyful splattering sound, the rhythmic drumming of the raindrops on rooftops and leaves. Then, when the downpour ceased, and the sun would peek through, forming rainbows, he wished with all his cloud-being that he, too, could feel the satisfaction of helping the earth.

Nimbus would ask the older, wiser clouds, “How do you make it rain? How do you get filled with water?”

The biggest, oldest cloud, Cumulus Maximus, with a booming, thunderous voice, would rumble, "It’s a simple process, little Nimbus. First, you must gather enough water. You see all that water vapor rising from the earth? The lakes, the rivers, the oceans? We need to absorb that! We then have to become heavy, filled to bursting. Finally, when we are heavy enough, and the conditions are right…we let go.” He’d then let out a booming laugh that rumbled across the sky.

Nimbus tried to follow this advice. He floated near the oceans, hoping to absorb the rising water vapor. He floated over sunny meadows, catching the moisture rising from the grass and flowers. He even tried to ‘think wet thoughts’, as the other clouds joked. He focused on the deep blue of the sea, the coolness of the rain, but nothing worked. He remained stubbornly white and fluffy.

The other clouds started to tease him. “Look at Nimbus, still a fluffy bunny cloud!” they would giggle. “Never a raindrop will you form!”

Nimbus felt a huge wave of sadness and his fluffy form began to droop. He felt discouraged. He started to isolate himself, drifting away from the larger cloud gatherings.

One particularly sunny afternoon, Nimbus was drifting alone when he noticed a little field of wilting sunflowers. Their golden faces were drooping, their petals dry and cracking. A little girl, with pigtails and a worried expression, was trying to water them with a small, empty watering can.

Nimbus felt a pang of sympathy for the sunflowers. He watched as the little girl trudged back and forth to the well, only to find it dry. He knew he had to help, but he was only a fluffy, useless cloud, or so he believed.

He looked around and saw the sun beating down on the field, the dry earth, the thirsty flowers and the struggling girl. His heart swelled with a powerful empathy for the parched earth.

Suddenly, an idea sparked in his fluffy white head. He concentrated on the little girl, the sunflowers and the longing to see the field thrive. He willed himself to be heavy, to feel the cool, refreshing feeling of being full of water.

He thought of the deep, dark oceans he had seen and the deep blue of the sky on a rainy day. He closed his eyes, imagining he was one with the water and he started to change.

Slowly, ever so slowly, Nimbus began to transform. His edges softened, his white fur grew denser. He wasn't feeling wet on the inside, but a strange pressure was building up within him. The sunbeams grew hotter as the pressure built within Nimbus and he struggled to remain solid and fluffy. He looked at the girl and the flowers.

Then, a single, tiny droplet, shimmering and clear, slipped out. Plop! It landed on the nearest sunflower, reviving the plant and lifting its drooping face.

Nimbus was astonished. Another drop followed, and then another. He felt a joy he’d never known. His fluffy form wasn’t the same. He was changing, becoming filled with the moisture he’d always craved, becoming rain!

The girl gasped, looking up in wonder as the sun disappeared behind the expanding cloud. "Rain!" she shouted with glee, clapping her hands. The sunflowers began to straighten, as the rain grew more intense, a gentle shower. The dry earth drank the water, rejoicing.

Nimbus wasn’t heavy in the way the other clouds had described, but the droplets kept coming. He wasn't bursting, just letting go, giving, sharing the feeling of water with the earth. He was raining, finally raining!

He watched with immense pleasure as the little girl danced in the rain, splashing in puddles. He saw the sunflowers stand tall, their faces lifted toward the sky, their dry petals turning a deep, beautiful green. He heard the joyous music of the raindrops, the rhythmic drumming he had longed for, and it was his song!

The other clouds, surprised by Nimbus’s sudden change, drifted closer to observe. Cumulus Maximus, with a hint of amazement in his voice, boomed, “Well, I’ll be! Nimbus, you've done it!”

Nimbus, now no longer fluffy and white but gray and full of water, couldn't reply. He was too busy sending down the gentle rain, feeling the joy of providing the very thing he wanted. His ‘fluffy’ form didn’t matter anymore, it had melted into droplets and poured over the thirsty earth.

As the rain began to lessen, and the sun peeked through again, forming a beautiful rainbow, Nimbus’s supply of water had dwindled, and he began to feel light again, almost fluffy. He had, for the first time in his cloud life, completely emptied his form to provide. He was smaller now, less full.

But as he looked at the vibrant, renewed earth, he felt a warmth spread through him. He wasn’t simply a cloud, he was a part of something bigger. He was part of the rain, part of the sunshine, part of the life cycle.

The girl, who was now inside the house, came back out as the rain stopped, beaming at the field. “Look, the rainbow, Nimbus!” she said to the sky.

Nimbus smiled, and a single tear-drop of pure joy formed in the remnants of his cloud-self. It splashed down gently on a bright yellow sunflower, providing a tiny extra drink, before vanishing into the thirsty earth.

From that day on, Nimbus was known throughout the sky. The other clouds, who had teased him, now admired him. They began to understand that making it rain wasn’t just about gathering and holding water, but about seeing the need of the earth and helping, with all your being.

They knew, if Nimbus could, they could too. The sky seemed a little less fluffy, a little bit wetter, a little bit more alive after that day, all thanks to the cloud who wanted to rain. Nimbus went on to rain many times. But not as much as his joy grew and grew with the love he showed.

Nimbus never quite forgot the feel of being a fluffy bunny cloud, but his heart was always warm, because he knew he could, and did, make a difference. And sometimes, on especially sunny days, when you look up, you can still see a tiny wisp of a cloud shaped like a fluffy white rabbit, smiling down on the world, always remembering the little girl, the wilting sunflowers, and the glorious day he finally, truly, rained.
