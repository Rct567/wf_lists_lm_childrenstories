<title>The Snowman's Dream of Summer and Finding Warm Sunshine</title><body>
Barnaby the snowman shivered. Not because it was cold, oh no, being made of snow, he rather enjoyed the chill! He shivered because he was *dreaming*.

"Oh, to see the sun!" he sighed, his coal eyes fixed on the gray sky.

A little robin, perched on Barnaby’s carrot nose, chirped, “The sun? But you *have* seen the sun, Mr. Snowman! It’s been shining all morning, look!”

Barnaby blinked, his twig arms drooping. "Yes, yes, a weak winter sun. But I dream of a *summer* sun. A sun that’s warm, that sparkles, that makes flowers bloom in every colour!"

The robin tilted its head, considering this. “Flowers? You mean like the ones I saw last summer? Red ones, yellow ones, blue ones…”

"Exactly!" Barnaby exclaimed, his voice a frosty whisper. "And butterflies! And bees buzzing! And... and..." He paused, trying to capture the fleeting image in his snowy brain. "And a field, covered in… green!”

“Green!” squawked the robin, hopping to a safer twig on a nearby evergreen. “Sounds… wet.”

Barnaby chuckled, a puff of icy air escaping his mouth. "Maybe! But I long to feel it, feel the warmth on my… on my… well, on my snow body!"

Suddenly, a tiny mouse, its whiskers twitching, peeked out from a hole at the base of the snowman. “Sunshine? Is that what you’re talking about, Mr. Snowman? I heard my grandma talking about a place with lots of it. All the time!”

Barnaby's coal eyes widened. “A place? Tell me! Where? How do I get there?”

The mouse scurried closer, its tiny voice barely audible. “She said… she said it was… *south*. Way south. Across the big, blue water. Lots of people go there when it gets… cold here.”

“South!” Barnaby repeated, his twig arms gesturing vaguely. “The big, blue water! Across the… the sea!”

The robin hopped back onto his nose. "That’s a long way, Mr. Snowman. You’d melt before you even got to the sea!"

Barnaby slumped a little, his snowy form deflating slightly. “Oh, dear. I suppose you’re right.”

The mouse, however, had a thoughtful expression. “Wait! My grandma said… something else. She said the… the… the magic… might be *inside* someone’s heart.”

Barnaby frowned, tilting his carrot nose. "Inside someone's heart? How would sunshine be inside a heart?"

“I don’t know, Mr. Snowman!” the mouse squeaked. “She was a very… old mouse. But she always knew things!”

The robin preened a feather thoughtfully. “Well, maybe… maybe someone could help him?” It looked towards a little girl skipping towards them, her cheeks rosy red. “Lily! Lily is always kind. She always helps.”

Lily, seeing the snowman, stopped and smiled. “Hello, Barnaby! You look… thoughtful today.”

Barnaby sighed, the frosted breath puffing from his coal eyes. “I’m dreaming of sunshine, Lily. Real sunshine. Warm sunshine. But everyone says I can’t go get any because… because…”

“Because you’ll melt?” Lily finished, her smile fading. She knew all about snowmen and their precarious existence.

"Exactly."

Lily put her mittened hands on her hips. "Hmm. That’s tricky." She gazed at the sky for a long moment. “We could try to find some… pictures? Like, of sunny places?”

Barnaby’s eyes perked up. “Pictures! That's a wonderful idea, Lily! But...but that's not quite the same, is it? I want to *feel* it!"

Lily tapped her chin. "Maybe... maybe we can *make* something?"

"Make what?" Barnaby asked, his interest piqued.

Lily beamed, her eyes sparkling with an idea. "We could make... a *sun!*"

"A sun?" The robin squawked.

"Yes! With yellow paper, and glitter, and… and maybe even a bit of that nice, warm orange paint!" Lily grabbed her backpack and began rummaging inside. “Come on, Barnaby! Let’s get to work!”

Barnaby, spurred on by the possibility, let out a puff of what sounded remarkably like laughter. The little mouse and the robin also began to assist, gathering small stones as anchors, the mouse finding shiny little pebbles, and the robin flitting and keeping watch for more supplies.

Together, the four – Barnaby the snowman, Lily the girl, the robin, and the mouse – worked tirelessly. Lily used some brightly coloured construction paper, cutting out a large circle and rays of paper. She covered the circle in sparkly glitter. They found a bit of orange paint in her paint set for added vibrance. Soon they held a brilliantly yellow paper sun.

When the masterpiece was complete, Lily carefully tied the sun with a red ribbon and held it so the light caught its brilliance. She then found a safe location to mount it, away from any breeze. They set it on the lowest branch of an evergreen tree, where the warmth, though illusory, made its presence felt. The robin and the mouse quickly got to work on the decoration of the tree's surroundings with pretty rocks and pebbles, using the tree itself as a kind of home to make the setting look welcoming.

“There,” Lily declared, beaming. "Now, close your eyes, Barnaby, and imagine it's real sunshine!"

Barnaby closed his coal eyes. The air grew still. The wind, which had been whistling through the trees, seemed to hold its breath. The tiny snowman did as he was asked, he closed his eyes. He took a deep imaginary breath and began to think of how wonderful his new life would become. He pictured green fields, warm breezes, and a golden ball in the sky, as they slowly warmed him.

The robin, chirping happily, flitted amongst the branches, keeping watch on the little sun.

Barnaby smiled a little, as he was happy. “I… I do feel… warmer.”

The mouse squeaked in agreement, his little face hopeful. “Me too!”

They all spent some time enjoying the warmth, for a little while. As they were busy dreaming, a little snow came down, covering all their works with a blanket of new white, creating the ultimate Winter wonderland.

Suddenly, the smallest voice, Lily’s voice, broke the magical spell, asking if anyone could hear someone else, coming along the path, who also had been dreaming. Barnaby, surprised, did as he was asked, turning his head towards the new figure approaching the path. As he turned, it was easy to see. There, marching along the pathway, was another snowman! The new Snowman smiled, waving its twig arm.

"Hello! I am Boris!" the newcomer announced. "Are you having fun looking at the sun?"

"Hello, Boris!" said Barnaby.

Lily smiled and gestured towards the paper sun. “We made it!”

Boris surveyed the little setting, and smiled too. He walked around, inspecting it from all angles, his face beaming with interest and joy.

Boris, it turned out, had traveled. And although he enjoyed the winter as much as his peers, he had actually been south, as the little mouse’s grandmother had also been.

"Yes, and it's wonderful," he replied enthusiastically.

"But…" He paused for a moment. "It seems… even better."

"What do you mean?" they all asked.

“I mean… I have brought some of my… sunshine with me!” He looked all around him. With the enthusiasm of someone excited to share, he carefully moved a little piece of snow, creating an easy entrance.

As he removed the piece, the four other characters leaned forwards. And there they saw… a small, shining yellow seed!

“When the sun shines where I'm from… they grow big, these seeds. Very big… with lots of sunshine in them!” Boris explained, enthusiastically. “If we plant it now, it might… even get a little bit bigger. We can have some of the sunshine right now!”

Lily was excited at this proposition. She took her gardening tools out of her backpack. Using a little bit of snow, they were soon to place the seed safely, giving the little seed warmth. They then carefully gathered all the bright stones and petals that had blown down, and used it as protection for the new little home.

They kept the snow away from its surface, hoping that the new seed could catch its own sunlight. After a while, a tiny sprout did start. They all celebrated, jumping for joy, as Boris said the most magical things.

“If we’re lucky, there is a big, big sunshine seed buried underground too!”

Boris stayed a while, watching over their seed. And they decided to start their own, brand new adventures. For once, they decided to imagine and travel on and make all their hopes, dreams and ideas their reality, not simply with pictures, but with feeling and action.

Barnaby finally understood! Sunshine wasn’t just a matter of warmth, or colours, or even being warm! It was about creating it, together, inside their hearts! And the more sunshine you had, the more you had to share.
The end.
