<title>The Mummy Who Never wanted to Scare the Others</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled deep within the dusty chambers of the Museum of Mostly-Ancient Oddities, lived Mortimer. Mortimer wasn't just any ordinary exhibit; he was a mummy. A very *un*ordinary mummy, actually. Unlike all the other mummies, who spent their days scowling menacingly and trying to look as scary as possible, Mortimer preferred a good belly laugh and a friendly game of charades.

You see, Mortimer had a problem. He was, in his own words, "a spectacularly rubbish scare-mummy." His wrappings, which were supposed to be menacing and tattered, always seemed to get a bit… flouncy. He'd accidentally trip over them, creating a comical pyramid of bandages that would usually cause the children to erupt in giggles instead of terrified screams.

His sarcophagus, carved with images of fearsome pharaohs, was actually a little bit… sparkly. Someone, probably a mischievous museum intern with a penchant for glitter, had managed to sneak in and coat the entire thing in a shimmering layer of gold dust. It made Mortimer look less like a fearsome ruler of the afterlife and more like a disco ball with a history degree.

And then there was the face. Poor Mortimer. Despite his best efforts at a truly ghastly grimace, his face was, well, rather charming. He had a tiny, almost apologetic smile permanently etched onto his mummified face. His eyes, although undeniably ancient, held a spark of undeniable mischief. Whenever he tried to look scary, he'd accidentally squint and end up looking more like he was trying to remember where he’d left his reading glasses.

The other mummies, a grumpy bunch led by the perpetually frowning Pharaoh Khufu, were constantly teasing him.

“Honestly, Mortimer,” Khufu would boom, his voice a raspy echo from millennia gone by, “you’re an embarrassment! You're supposed to be *terrifying*! Look at yourself! You look like you’re about to offer someone a nice cup of tea!”

The other mummies would snicker and rustle their bandages in agreement. They'd point their bony fingers at Mortimer, who would blush (or whatever the mummified equivalent of blushing was, perhaps a slight tightening of his wrappings) and mumble an apology.

One day, a group of schoolchildren arrived at the museum. They were led by a very serious teacher with a tightly coiled bun and a stern expression. The children, clutching notebooks and pencils, were instructed to be "respectful" and "attentive."

As they moved through the Egyptian exhibit, the teacher droned on about pharaohs, pyramids, and the afterlife. The children, however, seemed far more interested in the shiny objects in the gift shop.

Finally, they reached Mortimer’s sarcophagus. The teacher pointed a long finger, announcing in a dramatic tone, "And here, children, we have a truly fearsome example of… of…" She trailed off, clearly not prepared for the sight of the sparkly sarcophagus and the mummy’s apologetic grin.

Before she could recover, a little boy, with bright red boots and a gap-toothed grin, piped up, "Wow! He looks like he's saying, 'Hello, nice to meet you!'"

Mortimer, who had been listening intently, gave a little wiggle. The children gasped! They weren't supposed to do that! A mummy, after all, wasn't meant to *wiggle*. But Mortimer had just been so excited to be noticed.

He slowly, and with a bit of a rustle, unwound a small corner of his wrappings and, in a surprisingly high-pitched voice, whispered, "Hello!"

The children dissolved into fits of giggles. Even the serious teacher’s face softened a little.

"He… he talked!" exclaimed a girl with pigtails bouncing.

Now, Mortimer, fuelled by a burst of confidence (and a desperate desire to be liked), decided to try something new. He launched into a game of charades! He gestured wildly, trying to convey the word “sun.” His arms flailed about, his bandages threatened to unravel completely, and he wobbled precariously, nearly tumbling out of his sarcophagus.

The children roared with laughter.

He then tried to act out "pyramid," but accidentally made a shape that resembled a rather lopsided birthday cake. More laughter! He even tried "mummy," pointing at himself and falling over, resulting in a spectacular tangle of bandages and a very un-mummy-like display.

The other mummies, watching from the shadows, were mortified. Khufu facepalmed with a skeletal hand. "This is an utter disaster!" he hissed. "He's turning our sacred chamber into a comedy show!"

However, the children loved it. They spent the rest of their visit interacting with Mortimer, asking him silly questions, drawing pictures of him, and generally having a wonderful time. The teacher, eventually, gave up on maintaining decorum and even cracked a smile.

Word of Mortimer’s “performance” spread quickly throughout the museum. Soon, children were begging their parents to visit the "laughing mummy." Instead of being the most dreaded exhibit, Mortimer became the most popular.

The other mummies were furious. Khufu held a grumpy mummy council (a gathering held by shuffling and grumbling). “We must do something about this! This cannot continue! He is ruining our reputation!”

They hatched a plan. During the night, they decided to stage a fright. They would huddle around Mortimer's sarcophagus, whisper menacingly, and attempt to restore some dignity to the "mummy image". They planned a super scary show of teeth and claw.

The next day, the schoolchildren returned, full of excitement. Mortimer was ready for them. He cleared his… throat… and was preparing to greet them with a cheerful "good morning!" when a dark cloud descended.

Suddenly, all the other mummies emerged, glaring and groaning. They bared their yellow teeth and stomped their dusty feet. They tried their most intimidating postures and, in unison, let out a low, guttural growl. They’d been practicing all night, so the scene felt like a bad actors convention.

The children gasped, their laughter stifled. For a moment, the museum fell silent. Mortimer, frozen in his sarcophagus, didn't know what to do. The little red-booted boy who was especially a huge fan of Mortimer, however, stepped forward.

"Excuse me," he said in a clear, loud voice, "are you all alright? Are you playing a game?"

The grumpy mummies paused. They looked at each other, and Khufu cleared his throat. This wasn't how it was supposed to go! They mumbled amongst themselves.

Mortimer, gathering his courage, and with a secret wink at the children, unwound a bandage from his arm. He gestured to Khufu, miming the action of offering a flower. He mimed offering Khufu, then gestured with a big smile.

The children started laughing, a nervous, uncertain sort of laugh at first, but slowly, steadily, it gained momentum. Mortimer kept up with his gestures of kindness. Soon the others were shaking their heads and trying to stop it but it was far too late!

And then… something extraordinary happened.

One by one, the other mummies started to crack. One of them stifled a giggle. Another started to uncurl a little. Even Khufu, after a particularly forceful sigh that caused dust to fly from his bandages, couldn’t help it. A tiny, almost invisible twitch appeared on his skeletal face. And then, like a series of dominoes, the entire group of mummies erupted in laughter. Not a scary, menacing laugh, but a genuine, heartfelt, uproarious guffaw. They all fell over. The exhibit ended up looking like a comical heap of bandaged bodies on the ground.

The children clapped, delighted. The teacher finally succumbed to the overwhelming silliness and started laughing too.

From that day on, the Egyptian exhibit at the Museum of Mostly-Ancient Oddities was transformed. It wasn't just a place to learn about the past; it was a place to laugh, to play, and to appreciate the joy of being different.

Khufu, and the other grumpy mummies, surprisingly, eventually accepted Mortimer for who he was, a very rubbish scare-mummy. They’d even started to appreciate his sunny disposition, even, the other mummies started to giggle, on occasion. They realized, even the grumpy Khufu realized, that the best way to be remembered wasn't always to be scary. Sometimes, being a bit silly, making people smile, and offering a good game of charades could be just as important, maybe even *more* important.

And Mortimer? He continued to giggle, to charade, and to bring joy to all who visited his sparkly sarcophagus. He was, after all, a mummy who never wanted to scare the others. He just wanted to make them smile, and that, he had finally discovered, was the best thing of all.
