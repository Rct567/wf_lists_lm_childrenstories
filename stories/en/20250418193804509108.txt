<title>Becoming Friends With a Very Grumpy Troll</title><body>

Once upon a time, nestled between rolling green hills and a whispering willow wood, stood a rather ordinary bridge. This wasn't just any bridge, though. This bridge led directly to a shimmering valley, rumoured to hold the most delicious berries in the whole wide world. But, guarding this bridge, was a very grumpy troll.

His name, if you could even get him to say it, was Grognak. Grognak was, to put it mildly, a rather disagreeable fellow. He had a beard of tangled twigs, eyes like pebbles, and a permanent frown etched onto his rough, green face. His usual greeting to anyone approaching the bridge was a low growl and a demand for a toll – usually a shiny button, a perfectly round pebble, or, on particularly greedy days, a whole loaf of bread.

One sunny morning, a little girl named Lily skipped towards the bridge. She was a bright, cheerful child with hair the colour of spun gold and eyes that sparkled with an uncontainable curiosity. Lily loved adventures, and the tales of the valley’s berries had reached her ears many times. She wasn't afraid of anything, especially not a grumpy old troll.

As she approached the bridge, she saw Grognak, perched upon a large, moss-covered boulder, sharpening a rather fearsome looking club. He glared at her, his eyes narrowing.

“Halt!” Grognak grumbled, his voice a gravelly rasp. “State your business! And be quick about it.”

Lily smiled, a smile that could melt the coldest of hearts. "Good morning, Mr. Troll! I was hoping to cross the bridge to pick some berries. They say they're the tastiest berries in the land!"

Grognak scoffed. "Berries, eh? And what do you have for the toll?"

Lily rummaged in her little wicker basket. She’d brought a collection of treasures to trade. She held up a smooth, grey stone. "Would you like this beautiful stone?"

Grognak wrinkled his nose. “Bah! A common rock. Useless!”

Lily's smile didn’t falter. “Or perhaps…this daisy I picked?” She held out a perfectly formed white daisy.

Grognak snorted again. "Flowers? Worthless things! They just die."

Lily tried another idea. She brought out a small, colourful drawing of a fantastical creature with six legs and wings made of rainbows.

Grognak eyed the drawing. He did not like colours or art, in fact, he thought everything about colours were too frivolous. “Is that a...thingamajig?”

Lily giggled. “It's a Grooble! And it looks like you, kind of.”

Grognak narrowed his eyes. "It does not!"

“But it does. With a grumpy frown like yours, only a little rounder, and it seems a tiny bit like you in the hair, all twisty and all over the place," she said smiling "So do you like my Grooble?"

Grognak growled, "I haven’t made a habit of it, I don’t think I want one." He wasn’t sure if he meant the picture, Lily’s tone, or a potential friendship. His eyes had started to twitch. He realised his cheeks were burning a little bit. “Fine,” he muttered. “But it is temporary.”

Lily beamed. "Thank you, Mr. Troll! That will be lovely.” And with that, Lily was on the other side. She did not hesitate to venture past him, she took a running hop past him and ran to the forest. She waved him goodbye and called out over her shoulder.

She spent the morning filling her basket with the sweetest, juiciest berries she had ever tasted. They were so good, they nearly made her want to burst out with laughter. The colours were incredible, reds like rubies and violets like amethysts. She made a crown, she sat in a comfortable patch of grass in a circle with all the colours.

As she was making her way back, the shadows of the evening were stretching long. Lily knew she should head home, it would be a shame to have to give up on the rest of the day. But suddenly, she heard a sound. A sort of sniffle.

She stopped and listened. It seemed to be coming from the bridge. Hesitantly, she approached and saw Grognak. He was still on his boulder, but his usually fierce face was turned downwards, and he appeared to be…crying?

“Are you alright, Mr. Troll?” Lily asked gently.

Grognak looked up, startled. He quickly wiped his eyes with the sleeve of his tattered shirt. "N-nothing!" he growled, his voice thick with emotion. "Just...something in my eye."

Lily didn't believe him, but she didn’t press the matter. She remembered that being kind can be the answer to everything, and she realised a troll’s feelings must be treated like everyone else's. Instead, she sat down beside him.

"Would you like a berry, Mr. Troll?" she offered, holding out her basket. “They are the best berries ever!”

Grognak hesitated, but his stomach rumbled, giving away how hungry he was. He snatched a handful of berries and munched them down. "Hmph," he mumbled through a mouthful. "Not bad."

Lily smiled. "I brought extra.” She reached back into her basket and picked out the best ones. As she selected them and offered him a pile, she kept a constant stream of friendly chatting, not letting it stop, trying to comfort him as best she could.

They sat in comfortable silence for a few moments, eating berries. Lily noticed that Grognak seemed a little less grumpy than before, though the frown was still there.

"My, but it’s the same face! This is an awfully long day and I have to ask! What’s the problem?”

Grognak sighed. “It’s my birthday,” he mumbled. “And no one ever remembers.”

Lily's eyes widened. “Your birthday! Well, Happy Birthday, Mr. Troll! That sounds awfully exciting, is it always an awfully lonely day?”

Grognak shrugged, trying to maintain his usual grumpy demeanor, but the sniffles started again. “Always,” he confirmed, his voice barely above a whisper.

Lily's heart ached for him. She knew what she had to do. She thought that even though it was dark out, she should at least attempt. "Mr. Troll, could you wait here please?"

“Why?” Grognak sounded confused. He wasn't sure what she was up to, the fear and shock in her eyes as the light dwindled had scared him quite a bit.

“Please!” was all she said before heading off on the opposite direction, leaving him behind. He tried to feel, to stop the feelings and to try to hide the embarrassment of them all. How could anyone be kind to a creature like him, but Lily was going to come back and so he knew she wouldn’t lie to him.

Lily, with a determined look in her eyes, hurried to the nearest houses. She started going door to door, asking people, her energy was running low but she did not care. They looked tired but gave her the information she required.
Lily, went back to the bridge with as many cakes and small gifts as she could carry. Each door provided more information and new recipes to help her assist Grognak. They came back together and stood in front of him with great excitement.

“Surprise!” They shouted in unison. Lily held up a cake topped with berries and with it a handmade card that read, “Happy Birthday, Mr. Troll! From your new friends!”

Grognak was stunned. He stared at them, his jaw agape, a mixture of emotions swirling within him. He saw the kind faces of the townsfolk, each carrying a small gift, each smiling at him. He even saw someone carrying the groceries. It made him feel like he couldn't get used to feeling and he was extremely thankful to the people who didn't know him but he knew he would be thankful forever.
Lily stood beside Grognak, excited.

For the first time in… well, in forever, Grognak felt a warm sensation spreading through his chest, it wasn't indigestion and it was definitely a very new feeling. He looked at the cake, then at the kind faces of his newfound friends, and then back to Lily, whose eyes were shining. A genuine smile, perhaps the first one ever, crept across his face. His grumpy face felt strange to feel but was amazing.

“Thank you,” he whispered, his voice trembling slightly. “This is… the best birthday… ever.”

From that day on, the bridge was no longer guarded by a grumpy troll. Grognak still collected his toll, but it was now more likely to be a joke or a friendly hello. The bridge wasn't just a bridge anymore; it was a symbol of friendship and the transformative power of kindness. Lily and Grognak became the best of friends, and the whole valley was filled with the echoes of laughter and joy, far more delicious than even the tastiest berries. And, every year, on Grognak's birthday, the townspeople, along with Lily, would gather at the bridge to celebrate the day the very grumpy troll became a very good friend. The tale of Grognak's adventure remained in the village to show them it's alright to become soft every so often and for everyone.
