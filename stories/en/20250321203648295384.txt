<title>When Santa Claus Forgot the Presents in the Town Square Quickly.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and a sparkling blue river, lay a little town called Sunny Meadow. Sunny Meadow was a happy place, full of chirping birds, giggling children, and friendly neighbors who always waved hello. And every year, as the crisp winter air began to whistle through the trees, Sunny Meadow prepared for its favorite day: Christmas!

The children of Sunny Meadow, especially, loved Christmas. They loved the twinkling lights that adorned every house, the smell of freshly baked cookies wafting from every window, and most of all, they loved the presents. They wrote long letters to Santa Claus, carefully detailing their wishes, hoping for toys, books, and maybe even a fluffy new puppy!

This year, the anticipation was higher than ever. A giant, sparkling Christmas tree stood proudly in the Town Square, decorated with hundreds of colorful ornaments and topped with a shining star. Carols filled the air, sung by a choir of children bundled in their warmest coats and mittens. Everyone in Sunny Meadow felt a joyful buzz of excitement, waiting for the magical night when Santa Claus would visit.

But this year, something was different. Something very, very unusual.

You see, Santa Claus, despite being a jolly, kind, and generally very organized man, was having a bit of a problem. He had been working overtime in his workshop at the North Pole, overseeing the creation of millions of toys, sorting them, and packing them all into his big, red sleigh. The elves were buzzing around like busy bees, and the reindeer were getting restless, pawing the snow and practicing their take-off runs.

With all this commotion, and perhaps one too many cups of hot cocoa, Santa Claus was a bit… distracted.

On Christmas Eve, Santa Claus climbed into his sleigh, checked his list (twice!), and gave the reindeer a hearty “Ho, ho, ho! Let’s go!” The sleigh zoomed up into the night sky, soaring over snow-covered mountains and twinkling cities. He landed in the first town, and, going by his schedule, he knew he was heading towards Sunny Meadow, which was almost due.

Santa started his usual route, carefully sliding down the chimneys of homes and placing presents under the Christmas trees. He chuckled, watching sleeping children dream their sweet dreams, imagining their faces light up when they found the gifts in the morning. He ate a cookie (or two, or three), left a carrot for Rudolph, and flew to the next house.

Santa continued on his route, a twinkle in his eye, ensuring every child got exactly what they wished for. He smiled, appreciating the neat layout of his route in his mind.
His list was followed and followed it was again, as per protocol. 

Suddenly, when it came time to go to Sunny Meadow, disaster struck! Santa felt a pang in his memory, an empty feeling as he pulled his sleigh over the bright lights of Sunny Meadow. He looked down at the houses in his list to confirm it. It looked right.

He flew towards Sunny Meadow to begin his deliveries as planned and expected to remember the presents there, or at least know where to grab the items in the sleigh, and everything to drop in all homes for children that he knew.

Unfortunately, as Santa landed his sleigh in the Town Square of Sunny Meadow, the one place everyone met at for their Christmas mornings and afternoons. 
Santa realized with a jolt, a very big, heavy, stomach-dropping jolt, that… he had forgotten the presents!

His jaw dropped, his eyes widened, and his rosy cheeks turned a shade of pink he had never experienced before. "Oh dear, oh my goodness, oh dear, oh my goodness!" he exclaimed, pacing back and forth in a frenzy. "I've forgotten the presents! All the presents for Sunny Meadow! How could this happen? The little town in all towns?"

He checked the sleigh. Empty. He checked his list, his pockets, even under his big, red hat. Empty, empty, empty! He looked over his list on the map, it seemed to have gone through Sunny Meadow, right towards other children's houses too, so a second or two of thinking brought a panic attack right up to his heart and into his mind. "Quickly!" he shouted, running to the reindeers, looking as the Town Square lights flashed. "I need to act before they start, or Christmas is ruined!", he shouted again to the reindeers.

What was he to do? The children of Sunny Meadow, the good little boys and girls, were expecting him, he thought out loud. How could he disappoint them? Christmas was nearly ruined! It was his most important work after all!

He paced the snowy ground, trying to think, trying to remember, the time ticking away and Christmas Morning on the horizon. He could fly back to the North Pole, but it would take hours and all the Sunny Meadow kids will have found nothing as soon as the morning light appears on their window, and Santa can't go around the world at high speeds, just like that! It wasn’t possible, he remembered again.

Santa saw the shining lights on the tree and the decorations and took a look down the small roads of Sunny Meadow. It was the perfect idea!

Then, he had an idea! A truly brilliant, Santa-sized idea! “The shops!”, he cried with a smile, finally bringing out the solution. He was talking to the reindeers still. Sunny Meadow had plenty of stores and shops filled with wonderful toys, books, and games. All they needed to do was get what they wanted!

Santa, with a burst of energy, jumped back in his sleigh and gave the reindeer a quick command. “To the shops!” he called out as the reindeers took flight.

First, Santa Claus flew to the toy shop. The shop was filled with building blocks, plush animals, and race cars. With a flurry of Christmas magic, he gathered up the presents from the toy shop and filled his sleigh with a collection of toys that, with some Christmas ingenuity and thinking, could bring fun to the many Sunny Meadow boys and girls.

Next, they zipped over to the bookstore, collecting chapter books, coloring books and magazines of puzzles for the kids, and he filled the sleigh again with an assortment that would leave any kids very entertained.

After the books came the clothing store, where he grabbed warm sweaters, fluffy hats, and colourful scarves for the kids that may feel chilly as the weather came into winter.

Santa continued his mad dash around the town, collecting gifts from the other shops. He found art supplies, sparkly jewelry, sports equipment, and anything else he thought the children might want. With each stop, he gathered items with an urgency that mirrored his earlier stress!

Then came the magic part. Carefully, so that nobody could get up and see him doing what they should be doing. As the first light of the day broke on the horizon, Santa, using his special Christmas magic, visited every house in Sunny Meadow. With an effort that nobody in the town could think of being normal, he managed to sneak the presents in through the doors and chimney and put them under the Christmas trees.

When Santa finally arrived back at his sleigh, he slumped on the seat in his sleigh. Santa was very tired, but smiling. Exhausted but excited. The magic, which usually came to him without too much strain, seemed to require all his focus.

Finally, Santa smiled once more and felt satisfied, and that moment was magical for Santa. All kids are prepared with nice items and clothing items to feel warm and happy! And he started his path.

On Christmas morning, as the sun peeked over the hills, the children of Sunny Meadow woke up with a jolt of excitement. They ran downstairs, their eyes wide with wonder, ready to experience the magic. And there they were! Underneath the glittering Christmas trees, was a treasure trove of presents.

The children screamed and shouted and laughed with glee as they tore into the wrapping paper, finding their wishes answered! There were building blocks to stack high, fluffy puppies to cuddle, racing cars to zoom, and of course, every child seemed to love their Christmas.
Books, to read the great chapters in their minds, and colorful art supplies, so they could paint beautiful pictures of the snowy landscapes and all the magic around their town, and the hats and the coats.
Some also seemed to feel that they wanted to get out and move a bit, and that was possible too!

Sunny Meadow buzzed with a joyous atmosphere and Santa had the opportunity to see every kid was happy. The children built forts, read stories, played games, and made beautiful crafts. Everywhere the kids looked there were smiles. Laughter rang throughout the houses and the Town Square.

As the day wore on, the people of Sunny Meadow gathered in the Town Square, celebrating Christmas. They sang carols, shared stories, and ate delicious Christmas cookies. All the people also understood each and everyone. They knew the importance of community. They were glad. It felt like another magic morning for Sunny Meadow! They laughed.

But there was something else. The biggest of the children, knowing some stories from the prior days, and being in charge, understood.
The people knew this, of course, being the nice children they are. They were also wondering what they have.
In the Town Square, a message had also appeared. This Christmas had a feeling of a very specific person, known very well by everyone around the Earth!
It was for Santa Claus.
They cheered with glee.
They knew how much hard work he had done.
He always worked at his best.
They were proud of him!
This Christmas, Sunny Meadow knew, was the most special one of all!

Back at the North Pole, after having enjoyed his warm chocolate and treats and sweets, with the elves singing, and the reindeer fed up, Santa Claus let out a contented sigh. He was exhausted, it was true, but his heart was filled with a warm, fuzzy feeling. He smiled as he imagined all of those smiling children in Sunny Meadow. He might have forgotten the presents, but in the end, he had still brought the joy of Christmas. He loved the town of Sunny Meadow! He wanted to be around them.

And Santa Claus, despite his occasional forgetfulness, knew that Christmas was always special, especially when there are great people to be around. He chuckled. Maybe he would make sure to write himself a note for next year, just to remember the presents. Just in case. And with a happy thought, Santa Claus drifted off to sleep, dreaming of snow, laughter, and the cheerful faces of the children of Sunny Meadow.
The end!
