<title>Learning Kindness from the Little Cloud With a Storm Inside</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, high above the world, lived a little cloud named Cumulus. Cumulus wasn't like the other fluffy, happy clouds. Most of them floated around giggling and playing games with the sun, casting shadows on the green fields below. They loved to race each other across the sky, painting pictures with their soft, white shapes.

But Cumulus was different. Cumulus often felt a rumble deep inside, a rumbling like faraway thunder. Sometimes, tiny flashes of light, like secret sparkles, danced within him. This made Cumulus feel… grumpy.

"Why can't I be happy like everyone else?" Cumulus would grumble, watching the other clouds twirl and dance. He would try to smile, to join in their games, but the rumbling would start, and a shadow would fall over his puffy little face. He wished he could just burst with joy like the other clouds.

One sunny afternoon, Cumulus was sitting alone, feeling very sorry for himself. He watched the children playing down below, their laughter echoing up to the sky. He saw a little girl with bright red ribbons in her hair, chasing after a butterfly in a field of sunflowers.

Suddenly, a strong wind began to blow. The other clouds scattered, pushed about like cotton candy tossed by a playful giant. The little girl with the ribbons lost her footing, tumbling to the ground, right next to a grumpy, old, dried out cornstalk, lying lonely in the middle of the sunny field.

Cumulus, feeling the rumbling inside growing stronger, watched. He could almost *feel* the little girl's surprise and unhappiness from above. He felt something strange stir inside of him, not a rumbling this time, but something… else. It was a feeling like… a pull.

He watched the little girl sit up, brushing the dust off her bright dress. She looked very small and very sad. She began to cry. Her tears shimmered in the sun. The cornstalk was so lonely that he was falling into the dry earth, his head to his long withered body.

Suddenly, without thinking, Cumulus began to change. His puffy shape shifted, darkening slightly. He wasn’t sure what was happening, but his inner rumbling became even more intense, yet it no longer felt negative. He looked at the sad, little girl in the bright dress, and for the first time, his "rumbling" started to change shape.

*Boom!*

And with a giant leap, Cumulus sent a small raindrop down towards the crying little girl, just as she started to cough, kicking the dry cornstalk's withered body.

The tiny raindrop didn't fall *on* her. It landed *next to* her, splashing on the dust at her tiny shoe, sending a beautiful stream of clean air. The girl jumped back at first, surprised, then looked up at the sky. And then, she looked at her shoe!

Cumulus watched with bated breath.

The little girl stopped crying. She looked at the raindrop and then at her hands, which were covered in dirt from falling on the dry earth. A tiny, tentative smile began to spread across her face. She blinked her big, blue eyes at the clouds. The cornstalk stretched a withered leg towards her in anticipation.

"Wow!" she said softly. "A raindrop!" She held out her hand, and a second raindrop fell into it. The cornstalk rustled weakly in gratitude, sending the tiny leaves on his crown swirling.

Cumulus, feeling the strangest feeling he had ever felt, sent down more raindrops. They weren’t big, booming drops like his rumbling would produce when he felt grumpy. These were gentle, small drops, just enough to help. Cumulus's rumble now felt less angry, and it began to move, creating the little sprinkles of rain the world needs.

The little girl started to giggle. Then, she looked down at the ground, and then at the withered cornstalk. Using one of her tiny feet, she brushed away the dry earth surrounding the old cornstalk.

Cumulus, astonished by what was happening, changed shape. Now the dark, gloomy, rumbling that lived inside of him began to dissipate. He saw more and more sunlight as he changed shape to follow the sun as it changed direction. He sent a little ray of sunshine down from the sky!

Cumulus wasn't producing rain that made it hard to play and see the sun, instead, he changed his rain from a boom to a sprinkle, and the sprinkle sent the dust flying and allowed her to see that cornstalk again,

Slowly, carefully, with many giggles and much careful concentration, the little girl began to dig in the dry earth. She wanted to see the root to place it down!

Then, Cumulus sent a small rain stream right over the girl's shoe, the other little clouds began to join Cumulus. They, too, understood, now! A light sprinkling started to fall, just enough to moisten the earth and help her. Cumulus watched the sun now peek over his shape as his anger left him!

The little girl started laughing in pure delight, now she could see a new root grow into the sun-touched moist ground, and the old dried cornstalk smiled weakly, almost like a greeting. A small stream of clear water danced beside her shoe!

The other clouds, seeing the change in Cumulus and feeling a gentle joy, joined in. Soon, a soft, sweet rain began to fall across the field. The little girl worked tirelessly, her red ribbons bobbing. Her tiny dress was quickly muddy and dirty.

The little girl held out her hand and received several sprinkles, then she smiled! The other clouds could tell Cumulus understood. Cumulus saw more and more sunlight peek from the sky.

When she felt satisfied, she brushed herself, looked again, and then started a new stream of sunlight from her finger that met Cumulus's sun!

"I'm done!" she announced. She stood back, gazing at her work. The dried old cornstalk was now supported, the root well placed into the soft wet soil.

Cumulus felt an odd sensation. He felt… happy. The rumbling inside had faded, replaced by a warm feeling. He wasn't bursting with joy like the other clouds, not quite, but something much closer to it.

The rain stopped. The sun peeked out. A rainbow stretched across the sky, its colors as vibrant as the little girl's ribbons. Cumulus, for the first time, truly understood.

The little girl, noticing the rainbow, laughed and turned and hugged the old cornstalk, her small body making her a tiny dot to hug the withered tree.

As the other clouds continued to float by and play with the sun, and Cumulus watched and smiled, he started to understand what made him feel so sad and "grumpy." It wasn’t the thunder inside, he finally understood.

It was the desire to *share* the rumble with the world. It wasn't about making a loud booming noise. It was about using the feelings he held to help and comfort. It was the thunder he felt which gave him the power to release the gentle rain to aid those who needed help. It was his way of *caring.*

The girl ran into the house, leaving her mud and footprints in the field. The cornstalk, touched with wet, breathed and breathed the wind and sun, finally feeling again.

And from that day on, Cumulus was no longer a grumpy cloud. The "thunder" still rumbled sometimes, but he knew now how to use it. He learned to turn his rumbling into a helpful friend, helping plants and the children when they were sad.

Whenever he felt the rumbling start, Cumulus would remember the little girl, the red ribbons, and the old cornstalk. He'd focus on that feeling, the desire to help, and send down a gentle shower, or a helping of sunshine to make all his friends happy.

He’d watch the green leaves sparkle, and the children's giggles echo up to him, and he knew, with absolute certainty, that he was no longer alone. He had found his purpose, his place in the world. Cumulus, the little cloud with a storm inside, was now a cloud of kindness, a cloud that brought smiles with its gentle rain and helpful sunlight.
And the other clouds? Well, they understood Cumulus better now, too. They learned that even the clouds with a storm inside could be the kindest of all. They all would continue to live together in the sky.
The End.
