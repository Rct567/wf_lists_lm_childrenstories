<title>The Cyclops Who Needed a pair of Eye Glasses.</title>
<body>
"Oof!" boomed a voice. "Blast it all!"

A small, fluffy sheep, whose name was Willow, baa-ed in fright. She’d been happily munching on clover when the ground trembled.

"Who's there?" she bleated, nervously shuffling her hooves.

From behind a large, gnarled oak tree emerged a…well, it was hard to say exactly *what* it was. It was enormous, at least ten times Willow’s size. It had one giant eye, right in the middle of its forehead, and a rather grumpy-looking frown.

"It's me, Gregory," the creature grumbled, scratching its chin. "And I’ve stubbed my toe again!"

Willow, who knew all the creatures of Sunny Meadow, realised it was Gregory the Cyclops. She always felt a bit wary around him; he seemed rather…intimidating. But she remembered her manners.

"Are you alright, Mr. Gregory?" she asked politely, her voice trembling slightly.

Gregory sighed, a sound like the wind rushing through a cave. “Not really, little sheep. I can barely *see* where I'm going these days. Keeps tripping over rocks. And stubbing toes.” He gestured to his massive foot, which did indeed look a bit red.

"Oh dear," said Willow. "Perhaps you should…watch where you're going?"

Gregory snorted. "If I *could* see where I was going, little sheep, I probably *would*! Everything's a blurry mess!" He squinted, which made his one eye scrunch up in a comical way. "It's a right bother, it is."

Willow pondered for a moment. "Have you tried…seeing an eye doctor?"

Gregory looked confused. "An…eye doctor? What’s that?"

"Well," Willow explained, "they’re very clever creatures. They look at your eyes, and if you can't see properly, they give you…eye glasses!" She wiggled her nose. "I saw Barnaby the Badger with a pair the other day. They suited him very well!"

Gregory blinked. "Eye glasses? For a Cyclops? I don't know if that's possible!"

"I don't see why not!" Willow insisted. "They're just…things that help you see. Let me ask Farmer Giles. He knows everything!"

And so, Willow, braver than she felt, trotted off to Farmer Giles’ cottage. Gregory, looking bewildered, remained by the oak tree.

At the cottage, Farmer Giles was busy mending a fence. He was a kindly old man with a long, white beard and a twinkle in his eye.

"Good morning, Willow," he greeted her. "What brings you here?"

"Mr. Gregory the Cyclops," Willow explained excitedly, "he can't see properly! He keeps tripping over things. And I think he needs eye glasses, but he doesn't know what they are!"

Farmer Giles stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Gregory, you say? Hmmm. A Cyclops with poor eyesight, you say? Well, now, that *is* a problem."

He straightened up and put his hands on his hips. "Alright, Willow, let’s see what we can do. We'll need to find someone who knows about these…eye glasses."

They walked back to the oak tree, where Gregory was still grumbling to himself.

"Good morning, Gregory," said Farmer Giles, his voice friendly. "Willow tells me you're having a bit of trouble with your sight?"

Gregory perked up slightly. "It's terrible, Farmer Giles! Everything’s a blur! I can't even see the delicious blueberries on the bushes anymore!" He sighed dramatically.

"We can help with that," Farmer Giles said with a smile. "Willow and I are going to take you to see Professor Owl."

"Professor Owl?" Gregory repeated, his enormous eye widening. "He knows about eye glasses?"

"He does indeed," Farmer Giles confirmed. "He’s the wisest creature in the whole meadow. Come on, let's go!"

And so, the unlikely trio set off. Willow, Farmer Giles, and Gregory walked along the dusty path, Gregory towering over them. It wasn't an easy journey; Gregory, not being able to see very well, kept stumbling over roots and nearly falling into a ditch. Willow and Farmer Giles, though a little worried, did their best to guide him, warning him of any obstacles.

Finally, they reached Professor Owl’s oak tree. It was a grand old tree, much bigger than Gregory's. Nestled in its branches was a small, cozy cottage with a sign that read: "Professor Solomon Owl – Eye Specialist."

They knocked on the wooden door. After a moment, it creaked open, and Professor Owl peered out. He was a very old owl with thick spectacles perched on his beak.

"Good day," he hooted. "What brings you to my humble abode?"

"Professor," Farmer Giles began, "this is Gregory the Cyclops. He’s having some difficulty with his eyesight."

Professor Owl studied Gregory with a knowing look. "Hmm, a Cyclops. Interesting. Come in, come in."

Inside the cottage, it was filled with strange instruments, magnifying glasses, and stacks of books. Professor Owl ushered them in, gesturing towards a large, comfortable chair.

"Sit down, Gregory," he said kindly. "Let's have a look."

Professor Owl examined Gregory's eye with a variety of instruments. He held up a magnifying glass, peered closely, and then made notes in a small, leather-bound book.

"Well, Gregory," he said finally, "it appears you have a mild case of…blurriness! Perfectly normal for a Cyclops, actually! But easily fixable!"

"Fixable?" Gregory exclaimed, his eye brightening.

"Indeed!" Professor Owl declared. "I can make you a pair of…specially designed eye glasses!"

He bustled about his workshop, rummaging through drawers and shelves. After a moment, he emerged, holding a large, circular pair of spectacles.

"Now," he said, carefully positioning the glasses in front of Gregory's eye. "Let's see…perfect! These should do the trick."

Gregory carefully reached out and took hold of the spectacles. He positioned them in front of his single eye, and…

"Wow!" he gasped. "I…I can see!"

He looked around, his eye darting about. "The grass is green! The sky is blue! And…and I can see the blueberries on the bush over there! And the little red butterfly! Everything is so…clear!"

Willow baa-ed with delight. Farmer Giles smiled warmly. Professor Owl beamed with satisfaction.

"Excellent, Gregory!" Professor Owl exclaimed. "You'll have to be careful with them, though. They're fragile."

Gregory looked at the eye glasses, then down at himself. He looked at Farmer Giles, Professor Owl and Willow. He finally looked up at the giant, bright eye he saw for the first time, and smiled. He was no longer grumpy and intimidating; he was thrilled!

Gregory thanked Professor Owl profusely, promising to take excellent care of his new spectacles. He and Willow and Farmer Giles then thanked the Professor before departing back to Sunny Meadow.

The journey back was a joyful one. Gregory could now see everything clearly, pointing out interesting rocks, and flowers and, most importantly of all, the yummy blueberries.

When they arrived back at the oak tree, Gregory turned to Willow.

"Thank you, little sheep," he said sincerely. "You've changed my life! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a great many berries to sample!"

Gregory then carefully picked his way to the blueberry bushes, enjoying the clear sight that he had not had in years.

Willow, grinning, watched him go. She turned to Farmer Giles.

“It's a happy ending, isn’t it, Farmer Giles?”

Farmer Giles nodded, a smile playing on his lips. “Indeed, Willow. Indeed it is. A little bit of kindness and a pair of eye glasses can make all the difference, even to a Cyclops!”

From that day on, Gregory was a different Cyclops. He was cheerful, he was kind, and he was always happy to help his friends. He still stubbed his toe occasionally, but now, at least, he saw it coming! And whenever anyone in Sunny Meadow had a problem, they knew exactly where to go: to Professor Owl, the eye specialist, with a little help from a fluffy sheep, a kind old farmer and a Cyclops with a newfound vision.
