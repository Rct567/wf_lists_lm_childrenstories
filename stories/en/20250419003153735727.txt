<title>Lucy's Dream of Flying to the Moon</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a small village nestled beside a shimmering, sapphire sea, lived a little girl named Lucy. Lucy was a dreamer, her heart overflowing with wonder and her eyes sparkling with the stardust of faraway galaxies. Her favorite pastime was gazing up at the night sky, lost in a sea of shimmering stars, and imagining herself soaring through the velvet darkness. More than anything in the whole wide world, Lucy longed to fly to the moon.

Lucy's house was a cozy cottage, painted the colour of sunshine and filled with the comforting scent of freshly baked bread. Inside, lived her mother, a kind and gentle woman with hair like spun gold, and her father, a weathered fisherman whose laughter could fill a whole harbour. Life in the village was simple, filled with the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides and the cheerful chatter of neighbours. But Lucy, she felt a different kind of longing, a pull towards the silver orb that hung in the night sky.

Every night, after dinner, Lucy would scamper outside, clutching her well-worn blanket. She would find the biggest, oldest oak tree in her garden and climb its gnarled branches, feeling the rough bark beneath her small hands. There, nestled amongst the leaves, she'd spread out her blanket and look up at the moon. She imagined herself in a spaceship, zooming past the twinkling stars, closer and closer to her destination.

"Oh, Moon," she would whisper to the glowing celestial body, "When will I come visit you? When will I finally get to touch your dusty, cratered surface?"

The moon, of course, never replied. But in her heart, Lucy felt its presence, a silent promise of adventure and exploration. She knew that one day, she would find a way.

One day, a peculiar event happened in the village. A traveling fair arrived, its colourful tents and exhilarating rides instantly capturing the attention of all the villagers, especially the children. Lucy, of course, was thrilled. Her parents saved up their precious coins so she could enjoy a day of wonder.

Amongst the various attractions, one stall caught Lucy's eye: a fortune teller's tent, shrouded in mystique and draped in velvet curtains. She remembered how her grandfather used to tell stories of mysterious fates, and it stirred within her a desire to know what the future held. She couldn't resist. With a mix of excitement and nervousness, she walked towards the entrance, her heart fluttering like a trapped bird.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of incense and something else, something magical. An old woman with a shawl over her head, sat behind a table covered in a black cloth, crystal ball gleaming under the soft glow of a lantern. Her eyes, dark and knowing, met Lucy's.

"Welcome, little one," the fortune teller croaked, her voice raspy with age. "I see a bright light in your future. What is your heart's desire?"

Lucy hesitated for a moment, then, emboldened, confessed, "I want to fly to the moon!"

The fortune teller smiled, a wrinkle forming on her lips. She took Lucy's small hand and placed it gently on the crystal ball. "Close your eyes, child," she whispered. "And see what the stars tell me."

Lucy closed her eyes, holding her breath. A rush of colours and images flooded her mind - rockets taking off, stars whirling, the Earth shrinking below her. When she opened her eyes, the fortune teller simply said, "The stars have revealed a journey for you. But this journey may not be as simple as it seems. There will be obstacles. You will face trials, but your determination will shine brighter than any star. Your dream is within reach, child, but the path is not easy. You will need something special. Something that will allow you to touch the moon."

Lucy was both excited and slightly worried. "What is it, what will allow me to touch the moon?", she asked the fortune teller.

The fortune teller gently shook her head, smiling and replied, "I cannot reveal everything. The path you chose is always of your own."

Leaving the fortune teller’s tent, Lucy's head swirled. The fairground rides lost their appeal, she could only focus on the words of the old woman. Days turned into weeks, then months, but her determination did not wane. Every evening she continued her vigil, climbing the oak tree, gazing at the moon, and letting her dreams fill her.

But one day, tragedy struck. Lucy’s father was lost at sea. A raging storm had blown up suddenly and his fishing boat was overcome by the rough waters. The village was thrown into mourning, a heavy blanket of grief covering every home. Lucy's sunshine-coloured house felt cold, the scent of bread never permeated the air, only tears. The sky that was her canvas now became dark and sorrowful.

Her mother, once full of laughter, was now consumed with a profound sadness, which only added to the weight in Lucy's heart. The world lost some of its colours. But, amidst the deep, dark grief, Lucy’s gaze kept returning to the moon, its silver face a constant comfort, an image that offered peace within a world that seemed determined to crush her.

One day, while clearing out some things from her father’s shed, Lucy stumbled upon an old, leather-bound journal. Inside were drawings of boats, sea creatures, and maps of the sea. On the final page, was a drawing, drawn with meticulous detail: it depicted a wooden rocket, rising towards the moon, made of spare wood and pieces of metal. Underneath, written in her father's elegant script were the words: 'Lucy’s Dream’.

Tears streamed down Lucy's cheeks as she traced the lines of the rocket, realising her father had known her dream. He believed in her, as much as she did. He’d always supported her crazy ambition. And although he was gone, his encouragement, his passion for seeing his daughter happy and full of dreams still lingered in the details in the drawing.

A newfound determination sparked within her. She would honour her father's memory and build the rocket. She will do it! She gathered her friends, and they began the laborious work of constructing it. It wouldn't be easy. They lacked the knowledge, the tools, the resources, but what they had in abundance was perseverance, and their combined belief in Lucy's vision, that would fuel their dream.

Days were spent in the shed, with the clang of hammers and the scent of sawdust and varnish filling the air. Her mother, seeing her daughter’s renewed spirit, and after a while decided to join her. Her mother, in her heart, remembered the passion she held as a child herself, her mother also enjoyed seeing Lucy in pursuit of her ambitions, bringing light back into her life after the tragic event. They used discarded wood from the beach, metal scraps, old pots and pans from the kitchen, all contributing. With each stroke of the brush, each hammering of a nail, the rocket slowly started taking shape, fueled by the power of grief transformed into love, a project of healing that also honoured her father’s memory and fulfilled a promise.

Finally, after many months, the day of launch arrived. The rocket, crude yet full of passion, stood tall, a beacon of hope against the setting sun. All the villagers gathered, their faces lit with wonder and anticipation, their shared hope and sorrow intertwining with the courage in Lucy’s own heart.

Lucy climbed into the rocket, a feeling of accomplishment warming her heart. Her mother stood below, tears streaming down her face, but they were now tears of pride. Her friends cheered. Lucy waved from the window of the homemade vessel and activated the crude engines, her eyes fixed on the silver moon hanging in the darkening sky.

With a roar and a cloud of smoke, the rocket lifted off, a patchwork of wood and metal, slowly at first, then with increasing speed. The villagers cheered. She flew past the familiar world, towards the distant starlight, leaving her old life, that still bore scars, behind.

As the rocket reached the upper atmosphere, Lucy looked back and saw the Earth shrinking below, a beautiful blue and green marble. Her heart soared. Reaching the moon required many sacrifices, her biggest one the loss of her father. But she was closer, fulfilling her dream with every passing second. She was now on her path, closer than ever.

But the old fortune teller was right. The journey wouldn’t be easy. The engine sputtered, and the rocket wobbled, and then, with a final lurch, sputtered into silence. Lucy was stuck. She had to go further, otherwise, all the sacrifices her father had made, she had made, everything would be for nothing. The journey had taught her about sorrow, her heart felt more at peace as the weight lessened with time, she had the drive to follow through to the end, for herself, and her late father. She knew then that her journey to the moon was more than just flying. It was about learning, and honouring the dream.

And with newfound determination, she realised her father would have never have given up and she had to fulfil that role, Lucy remembered her own words when she visited the fortune teller’s tent. Her mission was more about the journey than the arrival.

In that moment, Lucy remembered the moon in its full glow. The moon that provided her the peace of mind she required to endure such heartbreak, and gave her strength to be the astronaut she always desired. The journey she needed for such a mission, she had the support and backing of everyone, the path to the moon, was hers and hers alone. The moon was waiting, but only after a while, and now Lucy was fully prepared.

Lucy did eventually reach the moon. Her rocket landed, gently on the dusty surface, on a crater that bore a great resemblance to her own face, with her own emotions.

And in the end, she was not alone. For even though her father was gone in body, his spirit accompanied her, whispered into the solar winds, and illuminated the darkness with stardust, and the love that fuels dreams, her heart was whole, just as her father had always known.
