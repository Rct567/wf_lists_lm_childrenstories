<title>Tommy's Trip to the Ice Cream Shop</title>
<body>
Tommy, a bright-eyed boy with a mop of brown hair, loved Saturdays. Saturdays meant one thing: a trip to Mrs. Gable’s Ice Cream Shop! Mrs. Gable was famous in their town for her incredible, imaginative ice cream flavors. This week, Tommy had promised himself he would try something new. Usually, he chose his favourite, chocolate chip cookie dough, but today was different. He felt adventurous!

“Good morning, Tommy!” Mrs. Gable boomed, her smile as warm and sweet as her ice cream. She wore a brightly coloured apron decorated with little ice cream cones and sprinkles.

“Good morning, Mrs. Gable!” Tommy replied, his eyes darting around the shop, taking in the colourful displays. There were swirling cones painted on the walls, a chalkboard menu overflowing with options, and a freezer full of tempting tubs.

“Ready for something delicious?” Mrs. Gable asked, holding out a little spoon.

Tommy nodded eagerly. "Yes! I’ve been thinking all week. Today, I'm not having chocolate chip cookie dough."

Mrs. Gable chuckled. "Oh, I thought that might happen! What will it be, then?"

Tommy squinted at the chalkboard. "Hmm... there's Banana Bonanza, Strawberry Swirl, Raspberry Ripple... and then… oh, what's ‘Lemon Lullaby’?"

Mrs. Gable beamed. “Lemon Lullaby is a new flavour! It’s made with real lemons, fresh cream, and a touch of honey. It’s zesty and sweet, just like a summer breeze.”

Tommy’s stomach rumbled. That sounded delightful! "I think I'll try the Lemon Lullaby," he said.

Mrs. Gable scooped a generous portion of the pale yellow ice cream into a cone. "Excellent choice, Tommy! While you're enjoying that, how about we learn a little bit about where ice cream comes from?"

Tommy loved learning almost as much as he loved ice cream. He settled onto a little stool at a table, eager to listen. He took a big lick of his cone. The Lemon Lullaby was, indeed, delicious.

Mrs. Gable pulled up another stool. “So, where does ice cream start its journey?” she asked.

Tommy thought for a moment. "In a cow?"

Mrs. Gable smiled. "Exactly! Milk and cream are the key ingredients in most ice creams. And milk and cream come from…?”

"Cows!" Tommy chimed.

"Correct! Cows are mammals, and mammals are animals that feed their babies with milk. Now, milk is composed of different parts. The main part is water, but it also contains fats, proteins, and a special sugar called lactose."

Tommy chewed thoughtfully. "Lactose… is that what makes it taste sweet?"

“Partially, yes,” Mrs. Gable confirmed. "Lactose adds a little sweetness. But most of the sweetness in your ice cream comes from added sugars."

“Like the honey in my Lemon Lullaby?” Tommy asked.

“Precisely! Other common sugars include sucrose, which is regular table sugar, and fructose, which is found in fruits.”

Mrs. Gable pointed to a picture of a cow on the wall. "Farmers take care of the cows, providing them with food like grass and hay, and clean water. Then, the cows produce milk. The milk is collected and goes to a dairy, a factory where it gets cleaned and separated.”

“Separated?” Tommy questioned, tilting his head.

“Yes,” Mrs. Gable replied. "Milk is made up of many parts. One part is fat. To make ice cream, we often use cream, which has a much higher fat content than whole milk. Think of cream as being richer and thicker than milk. That fat is what makes your ice cream smooth and creamy."

Mrs. Gable then opened a drawer and pulled out a small, clear container of heavy cream. “This, for example, is heavy cream. Notice how thick it is compared to milk. That is all the milk fats together.”

Tommy looked closely at the container. “So, the higher the fat content, the creamier the ice cream will be?”

“Precisely!” Mrs. Gable exclaimed. “The dairy separates the cream from the milk and sends it to the ice cream factory. There, the cream and other ingredients are carefully measured.”

“Like the honey?” Tommy asked.

“Yes, and the lemon juice for your Lemon Lullaby. Then the ingredients are mixed together in giant machines to make a liquid mixture.”

“What happens next?” Tommy questioned, already finished with the ice cream.

“Next comes the exciting part – freezing! The liquid mixture is put into a machine called a batch freezer. Inside the freezer, the mixture is churned, or whisked, while it's being cooled down to very cold temperatures.”

“Like a really cold refrigerator?”

“Even colder! As the mixture churns and freezes, tiny ice crystals form. These crystals are essential. If the ice crystals are too large, the ice cream will be icy and not smooth.”

Mrs. Gable paused, grabbing a spoon from her counter. "Think of it like this… if you make a popsicle at home and let it freeze really slowly, you might see bigger ice crystals. That popsicle won’t be as smooth. In an ice cream factory, we control how the mixture freezes so the crystals are tiny. That is part of what gives ice cream that smooth, creamy texture.”

Tommy nodded, picturing the icy crystals in his head.

“During the churning process, air is also whipped into the mixture. That air gives ice cream its light and fluffy texture. The amount of air incorporated can affect how the ice cream feels in your mouth too. Some ice creams have more air than others, depending on the recipe!”

“So the churn is making the ice cream smooth and fluffy?” Tommy asked.

“Exactly!” Mrs. Gable said. “Once the ice cream is churned and frozen, it's then transferred into tubs, like the ones you see in the freezer. These tubs are then kept in freezers, very cold ones, to make sure your ice cream stays frozen. This prevents it from melting."

Tommy looked around the shop at the freezers full of ice cream tubs. “So, the cows give the milk, then we add sugar, then the batch freezer churns it, and then it gets put in tubs, and then…”

“And then, you enjoy it!” Mrs. Gable finished with a smile. “All that mixing, freezing and adding air – that makes ice cream, that makes delicious ice cream.”

“And the flavour!” Tommy added, remembering the yummy taste of his Lemon Lullaby.

“And of course, the flavour! You can add almost anything you like: chocolate chips, cookie dough pieces, fruit, nuts… it is only limited by your imagination.” Mrs. Gable smiled, “Now, there’s more to ice cream, of course. Did you know, for instance, that some people who cannot digest lactose very well, can still enjoy ice cream? There are some recipes with lactose-free milk."

Tommy thought about his ice cream cone again and remembered everything he had just learned. He suddenly wanted to take notes.

"Mrs. Gable?" he asked, grabbing a napkin and a crayon from the counter. "Can you write down everything you told me? I want to remember!"

Mrs. Gable laughed. "Of course, Tommy! It all starts with…," and she happily jotted down the steps, from the cows in the field to the delicious treats waiting for customers in the freezer. While she wrote, she glanced down at the shop and had an idea! "How about, instead of writing, we draw the steps as well?"

"That's an amazing idea, Mrs. Gable!", Tommy exclaimed. Mrs. Gable nodded and then they both began sketching down how to make the ice cream, using all the points and instructions from the recipe.

That day, Tommy learned more than just the history of ice cream. He learned about the process of making ice cream and about how fun it could be to try new things. He finished up by purchasing another cone, of course, to make sure the ice cream-tasting experiment was up to par. It turned out, in the end, that every Saturday had something to learn. And what a learning experience!
