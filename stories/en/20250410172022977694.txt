<title>The Werewolf Who Only Wanted to Make Friends.</title>
<body>
Barnaby Buttonsworth was, by all accounts, a werewolf. A fluffy, slightly clumsy, and terribly friendly werewolf. Now, most werewolves in the Whispering Woods were known for their growling, their howling at the moon, and their general aversion to anything even resembling a friendly chat. Barnaby, however, was different. He craved company, loved a good game of hopscotch, and possessed an alarming enthusiasm for baking biscuits.

His problem, you see, was his appearance. Even during the daytime, Barnaby was rather… woolly. He had thick, grey fur that always seemed to be catching bits of twigs and leaves, large, floppy ears that twitched at the slightest sound, and enormous, slightly worried-looking amber eyes. When the moon was full, well, let's just say things got even more… interesting. His fur puffed out even further, his teeth grew a touch pointier (though he’d never use them for anything but eating carrot sticks), and he'd often trip over his own paws in a rather ungainly manner.

He lived in a cozy little burrow beneath the roots of a particularly grumpy oak tree. The burrow was decorated with hand-painted mushrooms, fairy lights, and a rather impressive collection of mismatched socks. Barnaby loved to invite other creatures over for tea and biscuits, but alas, his invitations were rarely accepted.

One sunny afternoon, Barnaby decided he'd had enough of solitude. He marched out of his burrow, a basket brimming with freshly baked ginger biscuits in one paw, a small, hand-drawn invitation in the other, and a heart full of hopeful optimism.

His first stop was the house of Hazel Hare. Hazel was a twitchy, nervous rabbit known for her impressive sprinting abilities and her general distrust of anything unfamiliar.

"Hello, Hazel!" Barnaby called out, his voice a booming baritone that was slightly more woof-like than he intended. "Would you be interested in attending a biscuit-and-hopscotch gathering at my burrow this evening?"

Hazel, who had been nibbling on a dandelion, immediately dropped her dandelion and shot into her burrow faster than a lightning bolt. Only a faint cloud of dust remained.

Dejected, Barnaby trudged onwards. His next encounter was with Percy Porcupine, a creature known for his spiky exterior and his preference for solitary naps.

"Good day, Percy!" Barnaby announced. "I've baked some delightful ginger biscuits. Would you care to join me for some tea and a game of hopscotch?"

Percy, who was attempting to settle down for his afternoon nap, grumbled. He barely even opened his eyes. "Go away," he mumbled, "and take those… those fluffy… things with you!" He buried his nose even further into his cozy pile of leaves.

Barnaby sighed. He knew that the inhabitants of the Whispering Woods often judged him by his appearance. They didn't see the gentle giant with a heart of gold and a penchant for perfectly-baked biscuits. They only saw the werewolf.

He continued his journey, encountering a skittish squirrel who fled up a tree, a gossiping goose who honked disparagingly, and a grumpy badger who slammed his burrow door in his face. Barnaby's shoulders began to slump, and the basket of biscuits started to feel heavy.

Suddenly, he heard a small whimper. He looked around and spotted a tiny, lost ladybug struggling to right itself after tumbling from a particularly tall blade of grass.

"Oh, dear!" Barnaby exclaimed, his voice full of genuine concern. He gently scooped up the ladybug in his large paw. "Are you alright, little one?"

The ladybug, whose name was Dotty, looked up at him with wide, frightened eyes. "I… I've lost my way," she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Barnaby smiled a genuine, comforting smile. "Don't you worry," he said, his tail giving a gentle wag. "I'll help you find your way home."

He carefully placed Dotty onto a leaf and began to walk slowly, scanning the ground for any sign of the other ladybugs. He used his big, furry paws to gently clear away any obstacles that might hinder their progress, and he spoke in a soft, reassuring voice to Dotty all the while. He told her about his love for baking biscuits, his favourite game of hopscotch, and his dreams of making friends.

Dotty, initially terrified, began to relax. She found herself quite enjoying the adventure, perched safely upon the enormous, furry paw of the gentle werewolf.

After a long while, they finally spotted a group of ladybugs clustered around a vibrant red mushroom. Dotty squeaked with joy.

"My family!" she cried.

Barnaby carefully placed Dotty near the mushroom and watched as she happily rejoined her family. He felt a warm glow inside him. It wasn't the tea from his biscuits, nor was it the fire in his burrow – it was genuine happiness. He was glad that Dotty found her way home, and he had made a friend, at long last.

As he turned to leave, a tiny voice called out, "Thank you, Mr. Werewolf!" It was Dotty.

“You’re most welcome, Dotty,” Barnaby replied and his heart felt lighter than a feather.

Word of Barnaby's kindness spread through the Whispering Woods, carried on the wings of Dotty and other creatures she befriended. Initially, some of the creatures were sceptical, especially as the next full moon approached.

The night the moon shone its brightest, casting silver beams across the Whispering Woods. Barnaby, as usual, was undergoing his transformation. This time however, as his fur puffed out and his teeth subtly elongated, he did something different. He began by getting ready for a picnic. He gathered the ingredients to the basket with his special biscuits, made sure all of his favourite board games are ready, and then invited all his little friends to celebrate the full moon.

This time, a few brave souls, prompted by curiosity and Dotty’s heartfelt recommendations, cautiously peeked out from their burrows and houses. There was Hazel Hare, nervously nibbling on a carrot. There was Percy Porcupine, with his spines somewhat less defensively positioned. There were even a few hesitant squirrels peering down from the branches of a nearby oak tree.

Barnaby, his voice a little bit deeper and his movements a little bit less graceful, smiled and waved. “Welcome, friends!” he boomed cheerfully. "Biscuits and games are this way!"

Hazel Hare, unable to resist the allure of ginger biscuits and having heard that Barnaby would give no ill harm, tentatively hopped forward, Percy Porcupine, after checking that all was clear, hesitantly followed and the squirrels began to leap from branch to branch towards Barnaby.

Slowly, the other creatures began to approach. They saw not a fearsome werewolf, but a slightly goofy, genuinely friendly creature who just wanted to share some fun.

Barnaby, overjoyed, showed them the treats. Soon, the clearing was filled with the sounds of laughter, the scent of warm biscuits, and the joyous clatter of games. They played hopscotch, Hazel Hare was a little hesitant at first. He had prepared his game board with lots of different colours.

Barnaby, true to his word, even allowed the other creatures to bite onto his ear as it made for a nice soft chewing material.

Percy Porcupine, overcoming his apprehension, allowed a particularly small squirrel to use him as a makeshift hopscotch square, he grumbled for only the first time.

The evening passed in a flurry of activity. Barnaby, despite his transformation, remained the gentle, friendly creature he always was. He made sure everyone got a fair share of the biscuits, helped Dotty cheat at checkers (he thought it was cute), and even managed to give Percy Porcupine a very gentle hug (which the porcupine secretly enjoyed).

As the first rays of dawn touched the Whispering Woods, the animals began to bid Barnaby a farewell. The sun was up, and his transformation would start wearing off. The other creatures knew he was turning back into a friendly werewolf.

As they made their way home, they no longer saw the fearsome monster of legend, but a good-natured giant who just loved making friends and they had finally learned that sometimes, what you perceive isn't always true. Sometimes, what we think we know, changes as we get to know someone, or in this case, some "thing".
And so, the legend of the Werewolf of the Whispering Woods changed forever. From then on, he was known not as the scary monster but as the friend-making werewolf and everybody knew that, though he was a werewolf, he really was a nice person, after all. And even though the other animals could get scared, they knew now how the story should end.
And they lived happily ever after, playing hopscotch, and munching on tasty biscuits, and of course, under the soft light of the moon.
