<title>The Kindhearted Knight and the Dragon's Birthday Gift.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and sparkling blue rivers, lay the Kingdom of Glimmering Glades. In Glimmering Glades, lived a knight named Sir Reginald the Righteous. Unlike other knights, Sir Reginald wasn't known for slaying dragons or battling fierce beasts. Instead, he was celebrated for his kindness and gentle heart. He loved to help the villagers, tending their gardens, mending their fences, and reading stories to the children.

One sunny morning, a flurry of worried whispers rippled through the kingdom. It was Dragon Day! Dragons, as everyone knew, were fiercely protective of their treasure hoards and, frankly, quite grumpy. But every year on the same day, a very special dragon, a dragon named Ignis, held a grand birthday celebration high up on Mount Cinder. He was renowned for loving gifts, specifically, ones that were truly special.

The villagers trembled. They feared Ignis's temper and knew that failure to provide a suitably splendid birthday gift could lead to disaster – a smoldering village, at the very least! The king, a kind but rather anxious man, summoned Sir Reginald.

"Sir Reginald," the king stammered, "You are the most courageous (in kindness, that is) person in the kingdom. We desperately need your help! We must find a truly magnificent gift for Ignis, or we will all be... well, cooked!"

Sir Reginald, never one to shy away from a good deed, puffed out his chest and said, "Your Majesty, I shall venture forth and discover the perfect gift for Ignis."

He packed a small satchel with oatcakes, a book of poetry, and a map of the kingdom. He also grabbed his shining, but not very intimidating, sword, its blade blunted from years of accidentally poking brambles.

Sir Reginald knew the treacherous path to Mount Cinder was a long and arduous journey. First, he had to traverse the Whispering Woods, notorious for its mischievous sprites who delighted in playing tricks. Then, he would cross the Roaring River, where grumpy water creatures often demanded tolls. Finally, he'd have to ascend the volcanic slopes of Mount Cinder itself.

The Whispering Woods welcomed him with rustling leaves and confusing trails. Sir Reginald, however, politely requested the sprites' help. He even offered to read them a poem from his book, which, surprisingly, enchanted the sprites. They, giggling with glee, cleared the path for him, leading him safely through the twisting maze.

Next, he reached the Roaring River. There, he found a family of river trolls barring his way. They demanded gold or other shiny trinkets as a toll. Sir Reginald had no gold, but remembered a sweet story. He cleared his throat and, with great theatrical flair, began to recite it. The trolls, usually stoic and harsh, began to weep. Touched by his storytelling, they parted to let him cross, even offering him a helping hand over the deeper, rougher parts.

Finally, Sir Reginald began his ascent up Mount Cinder. The air grew hot, the ground rumbled, and smoke billowed. He knew he had to find the perfect gift. He scouted, checking every corner he could find to see if he could find something nice to offer Ignis. As he climbed, he noticed something peculiar - an injured bird with a broken wing. It was a beautiful, sapphire blue songbird, shivering from the cold and looking completely lost.

Sir Reginald’s heart melted. He gently scooped up the bird, and carried it carefully within the shelter of his cloak. He knew that this little creature, a living thing in distress, needed care. He was starting to think of gifts he could present, or build.

He decided to delay the quest for a short time, knowing he was not a strong fighter who could intimidate the dragon if need be. It would instead have to be based on heart. With much needed caution, he found a small cave, cleaned it out, and lined it with soft moss he found along the way. He then made a soft sling out of a piece of his cloak and carefully secured the bird.

Over the next two days, Sir Reginald stayed hidden in the cave and cared for the bird. He gave it water from his flask and painstakingly fashioned a splint from a twig to support its wing. He also shared his oatcakes, feeling the weight of responsibility for a creature much smaller than him. As the days passed, the bird slowly began to recover, chirping a little weaker, but better with each sunrise. Sir Reginald knew he was building something special for the bird.

His small caregiving adventure eventually made him forget about the birthday party and what he was even doing. He forgot about the grumpy dragon who was celebrating his big day.

On the day of the dragon’s birthday, as he emerged from the cave with the recovered bird, he finally remembered his duty and the upcoming dragon.

The sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows over the mountain, and he knew he was late. With renewed determination, Sir Reginald continued his climb, carrying the bird safely.

When he finally reached the summit of Mount Cinder, he found Ignis, the dragon, amidst a magnificent display of fireworks, mountains of sparkling gems, and mountains of shiny trinkets. The air was filled with the sound of laughter and feasting. However, Ignis, despite being surrounded by treasures, looked terribly grumpy. He was pacing back and forth, his smoke-filled nostrils puffing outwards.

The villagers had clearly brought lavish gifts. The largest was a mountain of gold coins. But the birthday dragon just snarled with boredom at them all. He stomped around, breathing fire from his nostrils.

Sir Reginald, even though he was late, was the next person to arrive. He approached Ignis respectfully, clutching the small songbird gently in his hands. He could feel the heat from the dragon, but did not quiver, and presented the recovered bird as his gift.

“Mighty Ignis,” he said humbly, "I apologize for my lateness. I got caught up… I wanted to bring you a gift, so I searched but did not find much. I happened upon this bird, and I gave all my attention into making sure it could live." He showed it gently in his hand, where it was healing.

The dragon stopped in his tracks. The festivities and jewels vanished for a brief moment. His eyes narrowed. This was not a jewel, it was not gold, and was a small bird compared to the treasure offered by the other guests. Sir Reginald held his breath.

Slowly, carefully, the dragon leaned in closer. He tilted his head. Ignis, the grumpy, fire-breathing dragon, suddenly… blinked. Then, he bent his enormous head lower, and snuggled, and huffed a little bit, closer to the tiny creature. He made a happy sound that sounded more like a cooing purr.

The other guests were flabbergasted, expecting flames to be launched towards the good knight.

"A... a bird?" Ignis rumbled in a voice that sounded gentler than it had any right to be. "A… a *living* thing?”

Sir Reginald nodded and carefully released the bird from its splint.

"Yes, great Ignis," he said. "It needed care. It was lost and hurting, and so, it seemed the best gift I could give you on your day was to help restore it to health."

The bird, feeling the freedom, gently took flight, soared into the air, and began to sing. It sang a beautiful song, a melody of joy, as it circled Ignis's head. The dragon’s tough, rough scales somehow turned as soft as flower petals.

Ignis closed his eyes, and breathed gently, with a sigh that could fill any room. All the fire in his nose disappeared. He smiled.

And suddenly, Ignis started laughing. Not the thunderous roar the villagers had become used to hearing, but a gentle, happy rumble, full of pure joy.

“That… that is the greatest gift anyone has ever given me!” he bellowed, happily. “Thank you!”

The other guests were stunned, confused. The king’s jaw had fallen to the ground, his anxiety evaporated as soon as the music started to play. All those gifts... completely useless in the end.

The other villagers offered him their lavish gifts, which Ignis, still ecstatic from the song, waved away. Gold, gems, anything shiny… meaningless to the big dragon. What did the dragon ever truly need, when what was already within him was more than enough?

Sir Reginald stayed with Ignis and his small songbird, at his new friend's side. He did not leave the bird out to the wild and made it his duty to feed it daily. He even taught the dragon new words like "gentle", and "compassion."

That night, under the twinkling stars, Ignis decided to build a new and grand palace atop Mount Cinder for his knight, and dedicated a new hall just for the songbird. The best jewels from all over the kingdom could not give this amount of comfort to both men and beast. The most lavish parties did not include the best things in life.

Sir Reginald had learned a valuable lesson: the greatest treasures are not found in mountains of gold, but in acts of kindness, a helping hand, and the beauty of a song. The real treasure, and the very best gift, was the compassion Sir Reginald offered, to Ignis, the small bird, and to everyone in the Kingdom of Glimmering Glades.

From that day forward, the Kingdom of Glimmering Glades and Mount Cinder were connected with a bond. Every year, instead of trying to outdo each other with extravagant gifts, the villagers would offer Ignis their love. It became the custom for everyone, rich and poor, to simply do an act of kindness towards someone who needed it. For that made the dragon happy. Sir Reginald, and the reformed dragon, together at the end.
