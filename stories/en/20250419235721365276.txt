<title>The Greedy Goose's Grumbling for Green Grapes</title><body>
Once upon a time, nestled beside a shimmering, bubbly brook and surrounded by giggling green grass, lived a goose named Gertrude. Gertrude wasn't just any goose; she was a goose with a gargantuan appetite, a grumpy disposition, and a particular fondness for green grapes. Oh, how Gertrude adored green grapes!

Her farmyard home, affectionately known as 'Giggle-Grass Farm,' was filled with the usual assortment of animals. There was Bartholomew the brave but slightly clumsy bull, Penelope the prissy but kind-hearted pig, Reginald the ridiculously rhyming rooster, and Beatrice the bossy but secretly soft-hearted bunny. They all knew Gertrude, and they all knew one very important thing: she *always* wanted more.

Every day, Farmer Giles, a jolly, red-faced man with twinkling blue eyes, would scatter grain for the animals. The other animals would gobble it up politely, often exchanging friendly nods. Gertrude, however, would honk with outrage, her white feathers puffed out, and demand more, even if she'd already eaten enough to fill a small hot air balloon.

"More! MORE! Honk! Where's the *best* grain?" she’d screech, glaring at Bartholomew, who, bless his heart, would often trip over his own hooves in fright.

One particularly sunny morning, Farmer Giles arrived with a bucket overflowing with a special treat: plump, juicy, *green grapes*! The other animals cheered. They knew how much Gertrude loved grapes, and they hoped, just maybe, she'd be a little less grumpy today.

Farmer Giles set the bucket down near the babbling brook. "Now, children," he announced, his voice full of glee, "these grapes are for everyone! Share and share alike!"

Penelope the piglet was the first to approach. She gently plucked a few grapes and popped them into her mouth, a blissful smile spreading across her muddy face. "Mmm, delicious!" she squealed.

Bartholomew, after a considerable struggle with his own large body, managed to select a handful of the green, glistening treasures. He crunched them happily, a faint dribble of juice running down his chin. "Good golly!" he mumbled through a mouthful of grapes.

Reginald the rooster, as always, recited a rhyme, grabbing a bunch as he did so. "Green grapes galore, what a treat! Sweet delight, can't be beat!"

Beatrice the bunny hopped forward, her twitching nose sniffing the air with delight. She nibbled at a grape with tiny, delicate teeth.

Then, Gertrude waddled into view. Her beady eyes narrowed at the sight of the grapes. “Mine! All mine!” she honked, her neck extending like a green-hungry periscope.

She pushed past Penelope, shoving Bartholomew aside with a forceful wing-flap. She nudged Reginald, knocking his rhyme temporarily from his mind. She practically snatched the grapes from Beatrice’s little paws.

Before the other animals could even blink, Gertrude had gobbled down nearly half the bucket of grapes. She didn't even chew properly! They went *glurp, glurp, glurp* down her long, graceful neck.

"Honk! These are good!" she grumbled through a mouthful, not a shred of gratitude in her voice.

The other animals watched, disappointed. They’d been so looking forward to sharing.

Gertrude ate and ate and ate, ignoring the increasingly forlorn looks from her fellow farmyard friends. Finally, the bucket was almost empty. Only a small cluster of grapes remained, glistening under the morning sun.

As Gertrude lunged for the last grapes, she tripped on a small pebble. With a squawk of surprise, she tumbled forward, landing headfirst into the almost empty bucket.

The animals gasped.

Gertrude scrambled, struggling to free herself from the slippery bucket. She was a flailing, feathered mess, legs kicking in the air, honking in outrage.

After several minutes of hilarious but rather undignified effort, she managed to right herself. She was covered in grape juice and grape skins. She looked, quite frankly, a comical sight.

"Hmph!" she spluttered, brushing grape debris from her feathers. "That bucket was not properly balanced! Someone… *something* is to blame!"

Then, disaster struck. As Gertrude took a step, a large, green grape skin, hidden in the leftover bucket sludge, slipped under her foot. She lost her balance again.

This time, instead of landing headfirst, she tripped backwards, tumbling into the bubbly brook.

"Oh, bother!" she cried, momentarily forgetting her grumbling.

The other animals rushed to the bank. Penelope giggled. Bartholomew looked worried. Reginald started rhyming again, seemingly unable to help himself. "Gertrude's gone, what a flop! Into the brook, with a *splop*!"

Gertrude, soaked to the bone and thoroughly miserable, paddled to the edge of the brook. She shook herself, sending a shower of water in all directions.

She then realised, with a startling clarity, something even worse.

She felt *awful*. Her tummy rumbled unhappily. She had eaten too many grapes, too quickly. The excessive sweetness had given her a terrible bellyache.

Suddenly, a loud, mournful *HONK* erupted from Gertrude’s wet frame. She wasn't grumbling about the lack of grapes this time. She was grumbling with discomfort.

The other animals exchanged glances.

Beatrice the bunny hopped forward and gently offered Gertrude a small, fluffy carrot. “Perhaps this will help, Gertrude?” she asked kindly.

Gertrude, in her rumpled and wretched state, surprisingly accepted the carrot. She nibbled at it slowly. She suddenly realised something important. Sharing, friendship, and not stuffing oneself silly had the potential for being much, much more pleasant than gluttony.

Penelope the piglet, sensing Gertrude’s change of heart, waddled over and gently licked the grape juice from Gertrude's beak. “Are you alright, Gertrude?”

Bartholomew, forgetting his clumsiness, lumbered over and offered to help her out of the brook completely. "Maybe we can go for a walk?" he suggested gently.

Reginald, never one to miss an opportunity for a rhyme, added. "The green grapes were a hasty snack, maybe sharing's what she now lacks!"

Gertrude, finally, started to laugh. The bubbly brook, the giggling green grass, her friends' concerned faces… it all made her realise how selfish she had been.

From that day forward, Gertrude's behaviour changed. She still loved green grapes, of course, but she learned to share them with her friends. She learned that kindness was a more satisfying experience than the feeling of a completely full stomach. She learned that helping each other out was much more rewarding than getting her own way all of the time.

Farmer Giles continued to bring grapes. They shared them, they enjoyed them, they even used the skins for a funny little slip-and-slide in the green grass! They made sure everyone, not just Gertrude, had a fair share.

Gertrude’s grumpy grumbling lessened and her honks of happiness became much more frequent. The other animals thrived on this improved state. Life on Giggle-Grass Farm, once again, was joyful and fulfilling, all because a greedy goose finally learned a very important lesson, all because of some green grapes. And Gertrude, although still occasionally yearning for a slightly larger portion of the green and delicious jewels, always remembered to share them with the farmyard crew, for the greatest of all virtues: being friends with one another. The end.
