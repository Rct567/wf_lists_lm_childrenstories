<title>If Wishes Were Whales, Where Would We Go Swimming First?</title>
<body>
"Do you think wishes are real, Lily?" asked Tom, kicking his feet in the soft sand. They were sitting on the beach, the salty air whipping their hair.

Lily, who was busy building a sandcastle, looked up, her brow furrowed in thought. "Sometimes, I do. Sometimes, I don't. What do you wish for, Tom?"

Tom sighed, picking up a smooth, grey stone. "I wish we could fly. Imagine soaring above everything, seeing the world from up high!"

Lily smiled, her eyes sparkling. "That sounds amazing! But flying is… well, it's a bit ordinary, isn't it? If I had a wish, I'd wish for something extraordinary!"

"Like what?" Tom asked, his curiosity piqued.

Lily grinned, carefully patting down the side of her sandcastle. "I'd wish for a whale! A giant, friendly whale we could be friends with!"

Tom’s eyes widened. "A whale? Wow! But… where would we even swim with a whale? The sea is huge!"

"That's a great question!" Lily exclaimed, abandoning her sandcastle for a moment. "If wishes were whales, not just *a* whale, but maybe *lots* of whales... Where would we go swimming *first*? Think, Tom, think!"

Tom pondered, scratching his head. "Hmm… well, there's the sea, of course. But the ocean is… ordinary. Maybe we should go somewhere really special." He looked at the distant horizon. "Maybe we could find a place where the water is… sparkly!"

"Sparkly water!" Lily squealed, clapping her hands. "Oh, yes! But where does sparkly water even *exist*?"

"Good point," Tom admitted, "Let's imagine, okay? Close your eyes and picture a place with sparkly water. Describe it!"

Lily closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "Okay! I'm picturing… giant, glowing coral reefs! The water is so clear, you can see all the way down to the sandy bottom. And the sand is made of… tiny, sparkling diamonds!"

"Diamonds!" Tom repeated, his eyes still closed, trying to imagine. "And… and the whales! What kind of whales are there?"

Lily, still visualizing, described, "They're rainbow whales! They shimmer and shine with all the colours of the rainbow. And their songs… they sing the most beautiful melodies, full of bubbles and sparkles!"

Tom opened his eyes, completely captivated. "Wow! I want to go there! Where *is* this place?"

"I don't know!" Lily admitted, giggling. "It's just in my head! Let's make it up! Maybe… maybe it’s a secret, hidden cove, at the bottom of the deepest sea?"

"The deepest sea! And how do we get there?" Tom wondered.

"With our rainbow whales, of course!" Lily declared. "They’d be our friends! They could gently carry us on their backs!"

Tom thought for a moment, picturing himself riding on a whale’s back, surrounded by sparkly water. "Yes! Okay, so… Rainbow Cove at the bottom of the deepest sea… that’s a good start! But what if the water *wasn't* just sparkly? What if… it could do other things?"

"Like what?" Lily asked eagerly.

"Like… taste like your favourite ice cream flavour!" Tom exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. "Or glow in the dark!"

Lily's mouth dropped open. "Glow in the dark ice cream water! Oh, this is getting better and better!"

"And the whales!" Tom continued, caught up in the fantasy. "What if the whales… what if they could talk? Imagine having conversations with the rainbow whales! They could tell us all the secrets of the ocean!"

"They could tell us where the lost treasures are!" Lily added, her eyes gleaming. "We could be pirate whale friends!"

"Pirate whale friends!" Tom roared with laughter. "Okay, okay, this is getting amazing! So, we have… Rainbow Cove, with sparkly, ice cream-flavoured, glowing water, filled with talking, pirate-friendly rainbow whales! Where do we go first, when we arrive?"

Lily thought for a moment, considering all the amazing possibilities. "First, we find the biggest rainbow whale, and we give him a hug! We need to tell him how thankful we are to swim in his magic world!"

"Good idea!" Tom agreed. "Then… then, we dive into the ice cream water! What flavor do *you* want it to be?"

Lily paused, thinking. "Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles! And a giant cookie to dunk!"

Tom laughed, "Perfect! I'd go for strawberry, and we'd race on the backs of the whales, all through the sparkly sea! But we can't *stay* in the water forever, we have to explore, so next?"

Lily replied "I would explore every nook and cranny. We have to investigate the sparkling sand and discover what secrets it holds and what kind of treasure might be buried."

"We can start mapping out Rainbow Cove, the way old pirates would on big treasure maps!" Tom continued the idea. "Imagine all the cool places we could discover! A cave filled with glowing jellyfish, a sunken ship made of chocolate… "

"Mmm, a chocolate ship!" Lily drooled. "We have to make friends with the jellyfish, too. Maybe they're friendly guards for a hidden pearl!"

Tom suddenly frowned. "What if there's… danger? Maybe some unfriendly creatures would want to eat the jellyfish."

Lily's smile faded a bit. "Oh… I don't want any unfriendly creatures!"

Tom nodded. "Me neither. Maybe… the rainbow whales could protect us? They're so big and strong."

Lily brightened. "Yes! And they could sing their songs! Their songs would be so beautiful, they’d make the unfriendly creatures turn into happy, singing friends instead!"

Tom thought about that, then smiled. "Perfect! So, the whales protect us with their beautiful singing. They're the bodyguards and the musicians. And their music will make the enemies friends!"

"Yes!" Lily shouted, happily. "Then, what about other friends? Other creatures in the sea? I want to see a group of dancing seahorses with fancy hats."

"I like that idea! They're all doing a conga line with some happy octopus playing the drums! Oh! And maybe mermaids could live in Rainbow Cove!"

"Yes! They have long, flowing hair that shines just like the rainbow whales! And they love to sing and dance! Maybe they're the ones that make the ice cream water. They would be our best friends" Lily explained.

"They definitely have to!" Tom exclaimed, then considered his plan. "So, we get to Rainbow Cove, hug a whale, dive into ice cream, race, find the pearl, map the place, make friends with the jellyfish, turn the baddies friendly by the power of beautiful whale song, and hang out with the mermaids. Does that all sound like a plan?"

Lily nodded vigorously. "Yes! The perfect plan! But… but how will we *leave*?"

Tom pondered this tricky issue. "We can't stay forever, although it's tempting. How about this, before we leave the magical realm we can go to any time in our minds, with the help of the Rainbow Whales. It will be our very own getaway, always ready whenever we need it!"

"That's the best of both worlds. We can visit whenever we want!" Lily exclaimed. "Oh Tom, imagine, we can change it to another cove if we want, if Rainbow Cove gets old, or boring or too many people are there. "

"Yes! Now, our job is to make our secret code words. In order to access the Rainbow Cove when we close our eyes and make a wish. How about: "Whale wishes, Rainbow Cove!" whenever we close our eyes!"

Lily jumped up, clapping her hands. "I love it. From now on, we will whisper "Whale Wishes, Rainbow Cove!" when we go to bed, during the day, whenever we need a dose of paradise!." She then got another idea "We also have to build this sandcastle when we're next there!"

Tom looked back at the sandcastle she started building and grinned "Indeed. And that would be just the start of the adventure." He stood up, stretching. "Right, let's finish this sandcastle then!"
They both turned back to the beach and set about finishing Lily's sandcastle, the sun warm on their backs, and the salty sea breeze filling them with hopes and dreams, ready for when "Whale Wishes, Rainbow Cove!" calls to them.
