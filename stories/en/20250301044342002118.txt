<title>The Wizard’s Apprentice Who Couldn’t Stop Laughing</title>
<body>
Bartholomew Buttons, a boy with a mop of bright orange hair that seemed to defy gravity, was the wizard's newest apprentice.  Not just any wizard, mind you, but the wonderfully, ridiculously, utterly zany Professor Fizzwick, whose lab was more a kaleidoscope of exploding colours and suspiciously bubbling potions than a proper place of study.

Bartholomew, however, wasn’t renowned for his studiousness.  He was renowned for his laughter.  A contagious, earsplitting, giggle-fest of a laugh that could shake the very foundations of the castle, or at least the rickety wooden chair he was currently perched on.

"Right, Bartholomew," Professor Fizzwick boomed, his voice echoing through the lab like a grumpy hippopotamus gargling with jellybeans. "Today, we are brewing the 'Potion of Perpetual Perkiness'.  Essential for... well, perpetual perkiness."

Professor Fizzwick tapped a bubbling cauldron with a spoon that looked suspiciously like a grumpy badger.  Steam, coloured a startling shade of magenta, billowed upwards.  Bartholomew, already close to tears of laughter, saw a particularly iridescent bubble floating over the cauldron and promptly giggled.

The giggle became a chuckle. The chuckle blossomed into a full-blown guffaw.  And then... a full-blown, uncontrollable, rolling fit of laughter.

Professor Fizzwick blinked.  He hadn’t expected that.  He surveyed the lab with a furrowed eyebrow.  Was the air suddenly too fragrant? Was a particularly potent puff of lavender drifting from some obscure corner? Bartholomew's laughter simply wouldn’t stop.

"Blast this wretched mirth!" Professor Fizzwick bellowed, waving his spoon wildly.  The magenta steam veered wildly into the air, a pink explosion of moisture that narrowly missed Bartholomew's face.  It was a perfect example of bad timing.

The potion, a rather unremarkable shade of beige, suddenly turned a vivid shade of emerald green, fizzed furiously, and launched a tiny, bubbling projectile straight into Bartholomew’s eye.

"Oh, dear," Bartholomew choked out, laughter momentarily interrupted.  He squeezed his eye and then, in that very instant, began giggling again.  The emerald-green projectile, apparently quite ticklish, was quite enough to get him going.  This time it was accompanied by the sight of a very dapper, very indignant-looking mouse attempting to chase down a disappearing jelly bean. The scene played out as a very funny silent comedy within the bubbles of the cauldron.  The result was chaos- and laughter.  More laughter.

Professor Fizzwick sighed. He was utterly baffled.   He grabbed a nearby bubbling flask, pulled out a strangely shaped wooden spoon, and proceeded to stir the potion with extreme vigour.  It frothed, and foamed, and began to fizz in a way that suggested it was about to detonate into a delightful confection.

Then, he poured the result into a small bottle and said, "For this potion to work, we must apply a most potent 'Smirk-Smudge' to seal it. And... it's essential you apply it with complete seriousness."

Bartholomew, still finding it extremely amusing, simply couldn't help the burst of laughter again. His cheeks hurt, his ribs ached, his entire body seemed to vibrate from the mirth.

The professor glared. "Look here, Bartholomew, this isn’t just a ridiculous potion. It’s about concentrated application of a peculiar, almost mystic quality.” He scowled. "This is extremely crucial. An important aspect is utter concentration".

Bartholomew looked solemn, and squeezed his eyes shut with a grim determination, a fierce glint in his eye, all of which vanished as a huge gust of wind (caused by Bartholomew letting out an enormous wheeze) resulted from a burst of laughter, shaking the very building itself. The entire lab, including a potted, angry looking cactus and a collection of miniature talking squirrels that appeared to be on strike, was suddenly engulfed in a massive wave of laughter. Even the teapot on the counter started snickering to itself.

The Professor blinked, and then chuckled at the absolute, unadulterated absurdity of it all.  He shook his head and rubbed his temples. Then, for a moment, a rare and very important, truly important thought occurred. He then said, very slowly: "Bartholomew, you have a most unusual talent."

Professor Fizzwick considered the situation. He then announced that he wouldn’t be taking Bartholomew out of the situation.  Maybe the laughter was just what this situation needed!  "Very well, my silly apprentice! Perhaps your mirth is the very catalyst we need to complete this magnificent concoction. Maybe we will learn how to harness this magical source of laughter! Maybe the key to unlocking its full potential is not solemnity but something…something…" The professor’s eyes widened. He looked at the perfectly calm, albeit perfectly delighted, mouse that was just starting to peel off the label of a forgotten jar. And with a sudden, beaming smile, he declared:  "Indeed, Bartholomew! The laughter is a necessary part of this recipe! Now, begin stirring!"

So, Bartholomew laughed even harder. And the potion bubbled and fizzed and shimmered even more beautifully and wonderfully than ever before.   And, as Bartholomew giggled, the potion of Perpetual Perkiness finally worked! It created a wonderful, vibrant and wonderfully colourful world; for all of them; just as intended!

From that day on, Bartholomew Buttons was known throughout the land, not just as the wizard’s apprentice, but as Bartholomew the Giggler, a man with no frown and only a hearty giggle!  And even though he never managed to perfect a single potion without an impromptu, chaotic burst of giggles in the lab, his infectious laughter made the Professor Fizzwick’s castle a beacon of boisterous joy for all who ventured in to have fun!  Because who needs serious potions when you have contagious, joyful laughter that could actually save the world?
