<title>The Magic Mirror and all the secrets held within.</title><body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a cozy little cottage at the edge of Whispering Woods, lived a young girl named Lily. Lily was a curious and adventurous spirit, always eager to explore and discover new things. Her best friend was an old, wise owl named Professor Hoot, who lived in a grand oak tree just behind her cottage.

One sunny morning, Lily was tidying up the attic, a place filled with forgotten treasures and dusty relics. Suddenly, a glint of light caught her eye. She crouched down and brushed away the cobwebs, revealing a magnificent mirror. Its frame was crafted from shimmering gold, adorned with carvings of swirling vines and whimsical creatures. This wasn't just any mirror; this was a magic mirror.

"Wow!" Lily exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder. "I've never seen anything so beautiful!"

As she gazed into the mirror, she saw her own reflection, but something felt different. The reflection smiled back, winked, and then, in a flash of sparkling light, the image began to shift. Lily saw herself walking through a vibrant, sunny meadow filled with colourful flowers she had never seen before. Butterflies with wings like stained glass fluttered around her.

A voice, soft and melodious, echoed from the mirror. "Welcome, Lily. I am the Keeper of Secrets."

Lily, though surprised, was more excited than frightened. "Wow! A talking mirror! That's amazing! What secrets do you keep?"

The mirror shimmered. "I hold the memories of the past, the glimpses of the future, and the whispers of faraway lands. I can show you anything your heart desires, but be warned, Lily, some secrets are best left undisturbed."

Lily, brimming with curiosity, ignored the warning. "Can you show me… a dragon?" she asked eagerly. She'd always been fascinated by dragons.

The mirror glowed, and the image changed. A magnificent dragon, scales shimmering like a thousand emeralds, soared across a vast, rocky landscape. It roared, and the sound vibrated through the mirror, causing Lily to giggle with delight.

"Magnificent!" she whispered. "Can I see more?"

"Of course, young one," replied the mirror. "But with each glimpse, you become entwined with the magic. Be mindful."

Lily continued to ask the mirror to show her incredible things: playful unicorns frolicking in a silver forest, mischievous pixies dancing under a moonlit waterfall, and a brave knight battling a fearsome griffin. Each vision was more captivating than the last.

As the day wore on, Lily became increasingly lost in the mirror's enchantments. She forgot about Professor Hoot, she forgot about her chores, she forgot everything except the captivating images swirling within the shimmering glass.

Suddenly, Professor Hoot's familiar "Hoo-hoo!" broke through the trance. Lily jumped, startled, and the image in the mirror flickered.

"Lily! What are you doing up here?" the owl hooted from the doorway. His wise eyes twinkled with concern.

Lily quickly turned away from the mirror, her cheeks flushed. "Oh, hello, Professor Hoot. I… I was just exploring."

Professor Hoot perched himself on a stack of dusty trunks. "Exploring what? The attic has been explored countless times. What's this beautiful thing you've got?" he asked pointing with his wing at the magic mirror.

Lily, feeling a mixture of excitement and guilt, hesitantly explained about the magic mirror and the wondrous things it had shown her.

Professor Hoot listened patiently, then said, "The magic of such things is alluring indeed, but be careful Lily. Magic can be dangerous if not handled with wisdom and kindness. Tell me, did the mirror warn you?"

"Yes," Lily confessed. "It said some secrets are best left undisturbed, and that I was becoming entwined with the magic, but I didn't listen!"

Professor Hoot nodded wisely. "The greatest treasures are often found not in the sight, but in the knowledge and wisdom you have." He turned toward the mirror, looking at its radiant surface. "And now, what have you learned from your little adventure today, my dear Lily?"

Lily looked back at the mirror, her eyes reflecting the shifting images within. She realized the endless sights it showed, did nothing to teach her about her self, nothing about what was true and right, or how she could love and grow. The wonder of it did not translate into useful and important truths that shaped the world around her. Lily answered him.

"I see the problem now! It gave me sights, but not my own thoughts, ideas or knowledge!" Lily responded with excitement. "I was so easily pulled away from my important tasks. It showed me great creatures but it did not feed my own sense of wonder. Professor, can we learn to change the magic? Teach the mirror how to do better?"

Professor Hoot was delighted by her insightful reply. "Indeed, my young friend. That is the purpose of all learning, not simply to absorb, but also to contemplate and build something of your own. The knowledge we discover within helps us change the world for the better." He hopped down from the trunks. "And I can tell you how. It takes compassion, honesty, patience and dedication to weave such powerful spells. We can help the mirror too!

Lily listened with rapt attention as Professor Hoot explained that to change the mirror, they needed to find the 'Heart of the Magic'. She must show the mirror her own compassion, honesty, patience and dedication, reflected back through their shared memories and lessons. "Show the mirror what you've learned," he said.

Together, Lily and Professor Hoot set out to show the mirror something more real. For many days, they brought it images of the real world: They gave it the feeling of the first snow, they taught it of friendships and caring for others, they had Lily tell stories of working in the community, and planting a garden to make people happy.

They showed it memories, the good, the bad and how they overcome sadness and obstacles together. They shared their own stories. Lily told the mirror about her chores, the laughter in her family and learning a new song on her own. Professor Hoot provided the secrets of nature, the wisdom that can only come with time, and how we're all interconnected.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the images in the mirror began to shift. The dragons became symbols of courage, the unicorns were no longer just symbols of beauty but reminders of kindness, and the pixies now demonstrated mischief and wonder.

"The magic is changing!" Lily gasped one day, noticing a difference in the mirror's reflection.

"Indeed," Professor Hoot said. "The mirror is not merely reflecting illusions anymore; it's reflecting the best of you and of me."

Then one day, as they were working together, a warm glow enveloped the mirror. Its golden frame seemed to pulsate with energy. And finally, with a great whoosh of sparkling light, the mirror shimmered, and spoke to them again: "Thank you, Lily, thank you, Professor Hoot. I now understand. I understand my purpose, I understand the power of choice and how much I must take that choice with utmost consideration. I thank you for showing me all this."

Lily was thrilled. "You can show us good things?"

"I can," responded the mirror. "But it won't always be pretty, perfect and perfect; I can now give you what is useful. I can help you to be resourceful, teach you from the mistakes of others and learn from what happens in the world. I now understand how to encourage goodness and help you grow!"

The mirror shifted, and now, it was showing Lily her life as it could be, one where she studied and became a kind woman, caring for those in need and helping the world a better place. Lily was overwhelmed with happiness. She knew the magic mirror was a valuable asset.

From that day forward, Lily used the magic mirror wisely. She looked to the mirror for encouragement, but always coupled that with a search for meaning and the need to develop skills herself. She never again allowed the mirror's enchanting visions to distract her from her responsibilities. Together with Professor Hoot, she used the mirror to learn and grow, shaping the world, making it a brighter and more caring place. The magic mirror was not just a source of wonders; it became a symbol of their enduring friendship, a testament to the transformative power of compassion, the importance of inner beauty, and the enduring power of working hard and making the right choices.
