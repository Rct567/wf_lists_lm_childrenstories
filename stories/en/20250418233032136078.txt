<title>Designing Dragons for Daring Dreamers</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a valley filled with giggling streams and lollipop trees, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily wasn't just any little girl; she was a dreamer. Her head was always brimming with stories, her heart aflutter with possibilities. But what she loved most of all, was dragons.

Lily didn’t just like dragons; she *adored* them. She read every book about them, watched every movie, and even drew them in her notebook during her lessons. Her drawings weren't just scribbles; they were masterpieces of imagination. She drew dragons with shimmering scales, fiery breath, and wings that caught the sunlight like stained glass.

One sunny afternoon, while sketching a particularly majestic dragon with horns that curved like moon crescents, Lily heard a tiny *thump* on her window. She peered out and saw a small, glittering creature hovering outside. It was a Spritely, a pixie-like being known for delivering dreams.

The Spritely, whose name was Pip, fluttered into Lily's room, his wings leaving a trail of shimmering dust. "Greetings, Dream Weaver!" he squeaked, his voice like tiny bells.

Lily, who had long suspected that dreams were made by magical beings, wasn't surprised. She simply smiled and said, "Hello, Pip! What brings you here?"

"The Great Dragon Design Challenge, of course!" Pip chirped. "It's a competition. The Dream Weaver who designs the most wonderful dragon wins a wish!"

Lily’s eyes widened. "A wish?"

"Yes!" Pip confirmed. "The wish is to be given by the Dream Maker himself! But only those dragons that meet the criteria are allowed. We, the Spritely council, have noticed that your designs are truly extraordinary. We would be pleased if you accepted the challenge!"

Lily’s heart skipped a beat. Designing a dragon for the most powerful magical entity, and for a chance to be granted a wish!

"Of course, I accept!" Lily exclaimed, grabbing her sketchpad and a fresh set of crayons. "Tell me everything!"

Pip explained the rules. "The dragon must be designed in seven days, taking into account all these elements; the first thing to consider are their scales, these provide protection. Next, wings are essential to assist flying. The fire breath - must have power and range. Next, think about size. Then, include the unique tail feature, this gives them power. Include the horns which can show them how to communicate and last is the personality!"

He continued, "The most important part of it all, is that all aspects of the design must work. And each part has a test to be met. It must also have a personality that shines through. You must be able to use each element to make the design! Now, let's get started!"

Lily was already bubbling with ideas. She dove into the challenge with passion.

**Day 1: The Scales of Shield**

"The first test, Lily, is about the scales!" Pip explained. "The dragons of dreams need scales that provide incredible protection. But they must also be beautiful. Come up with some designs and a story behind the colors you use!"

Lily knew just the thing. She decided her dragon would have scales the color of a rainbow, each color offering a unique power of protection.

She sketched a dragon with scales like ruby red. "Ruby red," she announced, "protects against fire! They will glow like the embers, but deflect any blaze."

Then, she sketched a dragon with sapphire-blue scales. "Sapphire blue," she said with enthusiasm, "protects against the storms! They can deflect powerful gusts of winds!"

Next came emerald green. "Emerald green," she continued, "protects against any diseases or poisons."

She drew scales of golden yellow. "Golden yellow,” she said, "protects from sun damage.”

Finally, she drew a dragon that was purple, but shined in the sunlight. "And purple? Purple allows them to blend in, and remain invisible when in times of hiding.”

Lily worked tirelessly all day. At the end, Pip examined the drawings. “The council agrees, each of the scales has strength! The strength of this design is high."

**Day 2: The Wings of Flight**

"The next challenge is to make some wings" Pip instructed. "The dragons need to be able to fly!"

Lily knew she needed something amazing! She started with the frame of the wings. She worked with two different options; feather and bat.

For her first drawing, she designed feathery wings, shimmering with iridescent colors. She knew that the feathers would allow them to turn mid-air!

Her second drawing, displayed leathery bat wings with powerful membranes that caught every gust of wind. With strong membranes, it would have a larger air capture!

Pip inspected them, testing them and finding them strong and powerful.

**Day 3: The Fiery Breath**

"Now comes the fun part!” said Pip. “The dragon must breathe fire! The test, however, it's about control, and use. What is your dragon's element?"

Lily had thought about this extensively. Her dragon wouldn’t just breathe fire; it would breathe a rainbow of different colored flames, each with a unique purpose.

“It will be a multi-element breath!” she announced. “But let me show you each."

She sketched her dragon. "Firstly, the Ruby Flame, which can make a big blaze when needed."

Next, she drew the Blue Flame, which turned into a huge wall, strong to ward off attack.

Then, she sketched the Green Flame. "The Green Flame cures, or can create!”

Then, the yellow flame to scare foes off, and finally the purple flame. "Finally the purple flame that casts illusions.”

Pip smiled. “It’s great! The multi-element fire is incredible, the control must be well handled in this part."

**Day 4: The Measure of the Beast**

"Now, comes an important aspect!" Pip announced, and Lily grew curious. "Dragons come in all sizes. The test is simple; your dragon can't be either too big or too small.

Lily’s original dragon wasn’t particularly enormous. Lily needed it to be an accurate measurement of size!

Lily did a sketch and drew.

She carefully sketched different dragons on a hill. The tallest, measuring 40 metres in length, then the shortest.

After much thought, Lily had a flash of inspiration. She created a medium-sized dragon! It would have the head and wings, which measured up well, and tail which added length.

Pip looked, "It has good scale and size. I like it."

**Day 5: The Power in the Tail**

"The tail," Pip stated. "It is important and can be used for so many purposes! It is where it uses its best force!"

Lily considered what purposes her dragon could need. First off, her dragon was made up of scales, and multi-colored fires, therefore, it was powerful already.

Then she looked at how to make a tail that fit everything. "How does it fit and balance all the features?" she pondered.

The next step, Lily imagined how the tail should have power. In her drawing, she made a powerful tail to knock foes off balance, with large scales, but still the vibrant color scheme.

"Excellent." Pip affirmed.

**Day 6: Horns for Communication**

"Now!" Pip exclaimed. "The Horns! These allow communication to other dragons! How does it communicate?"

Lily thought long and hard. Dragons, in the stories, are not known for using a lot of talking, so, she thought; how could they speak with a different method?

Finally, Lily devised something; her dragons' horns would have the power to transmit thought and energy into pictures. These could have the ability to work with other dragons in her image.

"What a clever concept!" said Pip, as he observed the drawing. "The power and imagery is wonderful! It should definitely make for some spectacular scenes."

**Day 7: Personality and Design Wrap-up**

The final day had arrived. Lily knew all the aspects of the dragon had come together and there only remained one part; a personality,

Pip inquired, "What is your dragon like, and why?"

Lily had made all of the drawings previously in relation to each other, but to explain all of it in an easy concept. "This dragon, named Aurora, is one of loyalty and caring. But Aurora must also look after the land; protect it, assist others, and ward off any enemy."

She drew Aurora.

She placed her in the sky. The scales shined with the rainbow, the multi-element flame ready to burst into action. Her horn allowed thought, and her wings allowed her to be there for her land and others.

Lily was happy with her Aurora and how she turned out! Aurora would fight for her land, and assist anyone in need!

Pip inspected all of her designs once more. He inspected everything, every aspect from the scales to the personality. Then, Pip's wings began to glow brightly, and a small whirlpool of shimmers began to build around him. When the shimmer stopped, there was only one single shimmering letter 'W'.

Pip smiled at Lily. "You've done it, Dream Weaver! You've created a dragon worthy of the Dream Maker's attention!"

A week later, a dazzling portal appeared in Lily's room. A tall, kind figure with a gentle smile and a crown of stars stepped through. It was the Dream Maker himself.

"Lily," he said, his voice echoing with warmth. "Your dragon designs are truly extraordinary. Your imagination is boundless, your creativity inspiring. You've poured your heart into this, and I'm pleased to announce you've won! I would like to award you your wish!"

Lily, beaming, stepped forward. She paused, looked at her drawing of Aurora and said, “My wish is to be a Dragon Designer, and to always have the tools to do so! And that Aurora helps me!"

The Dream Maker smiled and nodded. With a wave of his hand, he bestowed her wish. He summoned every drawing and a bag. The contents? Each crayon and paper she could ask for, plus magic to assist. "Your wish is granted, Lily. You will always have the inspiration to design dragons. Every dragon she draws can come to life for her."

Lily now possessed endless tools, ready to allow Aurora to come into real life. "Congratulations and good luck." said Pip.
Lily knew Aurora was going to come alive soon and that their dream had finally came true!

Lily, forever after, continued to design dragons. She drew dragons for kings and queens, for children and dreamers, and she knew Aurora, the dragon she brought to life would always be beside her, a guardian of her dreams. And every night, Lily would close her eyes, and in her dreams, she would fly, riding on the back of a dragon, soaring through the sky, a testament to the magic of imagination and the power of dreams.
The end!
