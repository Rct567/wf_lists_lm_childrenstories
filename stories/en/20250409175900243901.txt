<title>The Pixie Who Fixed the Rainbow in Time.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a valley painted with wildflowers and babbling brooks, lived a tiny pixie named Lumina. Lumina wasn’t like the other pixies. While they spent their days giggling amongst the daisies and polishing dewdrops on spiderwebs, Lumina possessed a particular fascination for the world beyond their hidden glen, a world of enormous things and strange wonders.

One sunny morning, Lumina woke with a tingle in her tiny toes. The air smelled of fresh rain and promises of adventure. She flew out of her mushroom house, its door no bigger than a button, and greeted the morning sun. But something was amiss.

Where a vibrant rainbow should have arched across the sky, a dull, grey smudge hung instead.

Lumina gasped. Rainbows were the most beautiful things in the world! They brought joy to everyone, from the smallest beetle to the tallest oak tree. This was a disaster!

Without a moment’s hesitation, Lumina knew what she had to do. She had to fix the rainbow! But how? Pixies weren't known for rainbow repair. Usually, the Rainbow Weavers, a legendary group of ancient pixies who lived in the clouds, were responsible for such delicate tasks. But the Rainbow Weavers, according to the ancient stories, were very busy, often tied up in knotty situations. The stories said if the rainbow broke for a while all the joy would leave the world, everything will become grey and cold.

Lumina, determined, started her preparations. She grabbed her little satchel, which held her most important tools: a tiny bottle of shimmering stardust, a miniature hammer forged from a moonbeam, and a coil of silk spun from a silkworm with a magical touch.

She needed to reach the rainbow's end. Where could that be? Legend said it lay where the rain met the sunlight, a place where colours were born. She remembered that place.

She zipped off on her journey, navigating past towering grass blades that looked like mighty trees and across streams that flowed like shimmering ribbons. Her flight took her over emerald fields of clover and through forests filled with fragrant flowers of every colour. She passed friendly bumblebees buzzing diligently, and cheeky squirrels who chattered greetings.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity to the small pixie, Lumina reached a place where the rain clouds were beginning to dissipate and the sun, a radiant sphere of warmth, peeked through. Here, at the edge of the rain, she spotted it – the broken rainbow.

It wasn’t as simple as she had imagined. The colours weren't just faded; they were frayed and tangled, as if someone had pulled them out of order and left them a knotted mess. It was an impossible mess.

Lumina landed on a single, broken band of scarlet, then cautiously examining the damage. She took her tiny hammer and tried to tap the threads back into place, but the colours only wobbled and shimmered. They clearly needed some extra help. She opened her satchel.

“Alright, time to get serious,” she mumbled to herself, which sounded like a tiny wind blowing.

First, she decided to try the stardust. Carefully, she sprinkled the shimmering powder across the broken strands of colour, whispering a tiny charm. The stardust did its work, and the colours brightened just a tiny bit, the faintest of shimmer returning, but the broken mess was still there.

Now it was time for the silk. The silk spun from the magical silkworm was renowned for its incredible ability to fix almost anything. She chose a single, slightly green-tinged silk, and began to gently weave the colours back together. First the scarlet, then the orange, the yellow, green, blue, indigo, and finally violet.

She was painstakingly careful, wanting to take her time. Lumina carefully started to work on the blue strands first. They appeared to be tangled at every edge of the rainbow and the broken pieces appeared to fade in and out of the sky.

As she weaved, a grumpy voice rumbled behind her. “What are you doing here, little one?”

Lumina spun around and found herself staring at a Grumble-Weaver. They were usually a very busy group and are not the friendliest to anyone but them selves, they did all the difficult jobs of creating storms. This one had eyes that looked like rain clouds and a nose shaped like a bolt of lightning.

"I… I am trying to fix the rainbow," Lumina replied, her voice barely a whisper.

The Grumble-Weaver huffed, making the air around Lumina feel chilly. "Fix the rainbow? Preposterous! You’re wasting your time."

“The colours have to be sorted," Lumina declared with sudden defiance. "The people and all creatures depend on it, they all depend on happiness. The world would not be joyous if there are no colours.”

The Grumble-Weaver snorted again. "The world is as it is, with rain and sunshine and grey. Why should the rainbow matter? The colour and light won't ever stay."

Lumina ignored the grumbling pixie. She knew she could do it. She knew she must do it. And she just carried on weaving and putting colours in order.

“And besides,” the Grumble-Weaver added, watching Lumina with a hint of irritation in his eye, "the Rainbow Weavers would do it."

"But they are too busy. No time to spare and there will be sadness everywhere!” Lumina replied with great certainty.

Lumina worked tirelessly, her small hands moving at a surprising speed. She could see that she needed to pull all the threads back to shape and she felt herself get even more certain. She paid no mind to the Grumble-Weaver and just carried on.

As Lumina worked, something extraordinary began to happen. As she put the blue back into order, the tangled strands of colour started to knit back together, their vibrancy returning with each precise stitch.

And as she worked, something even stranger happened.

The grumpy pixie watched in fascination, and with each new colour, the grumpy pixie began to soften. The rain cloud eyes began to sparkle, and a tiny, almost unnoticeable smile tugged at the corners of his mouth.

"I...I always saw colours as messy things." The Grumble-Weaver said to himself. "I make the storms for the fun of it. But maybe I've never paid enough attention."

By the time Lumina finished her work, the rainbow shimmered with an intense radiance. A perfect arc of colour, stretching across the sky. The brokenness and the mess were gone.

Lumina stepped back to admire her creation, her tiny heart overflowing with joy. Then, the Grumble-Weaver started helping Lumina by grabbing his hands, and helping Lumina restore everything back into the right order. Lumina felt so relieved because the help of the grumpy pixie made things go much more quickly.

The grumpy pixie stepped back beside Lumina to watch their beautiful creation. "It's... quite lovely, isn't it?" he mumbled, a genuine smile spreading across his face. "Perhaps rainbows aren't so bad after all."

And that’s where they remained for a while. Silently admiring their creation.

Suddenly, the sound of tiny bells tinkling in the wind reached them. The Rainbow Weavers had arrived, summoned by the magic that had been stirred.

They were a sight to behold, dressed in shimmering gowns made of sunlight and mist. They looked at the freshly restored rainbow and gasped in wonder.

“Who has performed such a feat?” one of the elders asked.

Lumina and the Grumble-Weaver shyly came forward. Lumina with her tiny hand held up with pride and the Grumble-Weaver, standing tall.

“I helped," Lumina replied, still speaking in a small voice.

“It was a pleasure to help.” The Grumble-Weaver replied, his words resonating with the satisfaction.

The Rainbow Weavers beamed at Lumina and the Grumble-Weaver.

"You have shown the world the true meaning of colours," one of them said. "You show that even the most broken things can be made whole, that even the grumpiest hearts can find beauty, and that the magic of teamwork shines brighter than any rainbow. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts."

As a reward, the Rainbow Weavers bestowed upon Lumina a new title: "The Pixie of Colours", her magic greatly increasing from that day. And as for the Grumble-Weaver? They made him their assistant, so that he could learn to appreciate the brighter things in the world.

From that day forward, Lumina and the Grumble-Weaver, alongside their new friends and newfound magic, helped keep the colours vibrant. And as for the valley of the wildflowers, it was forever changed. From then on, the sun shone a little brighter, the flowers bloomed a little more vividly, and rainbows arched across the sky more often than ever before, all because of the little pixie who dared to believe, the pixi who fixed the rainbow in time, and who taught the Grumble-Weaver to love colour too.
