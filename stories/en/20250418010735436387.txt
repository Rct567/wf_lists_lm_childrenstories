<title>A Fun Party with a Friendly Monster Coming Over Quickly</title>
<body>
Lily loved parties. She loved the colorful balloons, the silly games, and especially the cake. Today was extra special because it was her birthday party, and all her best friends were coming!

Lily bounced out of bed, her bright yellow pajamas practically vibrating with excitement. The sun was already streaming through her window, painting stripes of light across her room. Today was the day! She raced downstairs, her pigtails bouncing, to find her parents already hard at work, getting ready.

"Happy birthday, sweetie!" her mom said, giving her a big hug.

"Happy birthday, Lily-pad!" her dad chimed in, ruffling her hair. "Looks like everything's almost ready for your party!"

The house was already transformed. Streamers in every color imaginable hung from the ceiling. A giant banner proclaimed "Happy Birthday Lily!" in sparkly letters. The air smelled of freshly baked cookies and anticipation.

"What are we doing first?" Lily asked, practically bursting with energy.

"Well," her mom said, a twinkle in her eye, "we're going to set up the games outside in the backyard. We've got a treasure hunt planned, pin the tail on the donkey, and of course, some water balloon toss!"

Lily squealed with delight. The backyard was a perfect place for a party. The grass was green and inviting, and the colorful playhouse stood ready to host secret adventures. Her dad had already started inflating the pool, just in case anyone wanted to cool off later.

First, they set up the treasure hunt. Her dad had hidden clues all around the backyard, leading to a box filled with small toys and candies. The clues were rhyming riddles, perfect for children to decipher.

Next, they set up "Pin the Tail on the Donkey." Lily carefully hung the silly donkey picture on the wooden fence and handed out the blindfolds to her friends. She laughed as they stumbled around, trying to stick the tail in the right spot.

Then came the water balloon toss! Lily, with her friends, organized into pairs. The initial distances between teams were quite near, with each group passing the water balloon carefully back and forth, slowly stepping back as each round of successfully received balloons was completed. Soon, the air filled with shouts of excitement, shrieks of laughter, and the occasional satisfying *splat* as a water balloon burst.

Finally, it was time to sit down and relax for lunch. As they sat in their place mats, their faces glowing with happiness and covered with cake crumbs, her mom had an announcement.

"Everyone," Mom started, clapping her hands for attention. "We have a very special guest coming to Lily's party later."

The kids instantly quieted, wondering who it could be.

"Who is it, Mom?" one of Lily's friends, Mia, asked, her eyes wide.

"It's a... a monster!" Mom announced with a big smile.

Gasping and whispering ensued amongst the group.

A monster? Lily, though a little hesitant at first, trusted her mom, who always knew how to make things fun.

“He’s not a scary monster though,” Dad quickly added, seeing the hesitant looks. "He’s a friendly monster!"

Lily remembered her favourite book had a friendly monster in it. She grinned, her excitement returning.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of fun. They played musical chairs, sang songs, and opened presents. Lily received so many wonderful gifts, including a new art set, a fluffy stuffed unicorn, and a book about friendly monsters.

As the sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the backyard, Lily's mom announced, "He's here! Our special guest is arriving soon."

A little more whispering spread amongst the party goers. Lily had decided, if this was a good party, she didn’t mind the presence of a friendly monster one bit!

Everyone, including Lily, ran towards the gate. Then, suddenly, a large shadow fell over them.

They gasped. A giant, purple, furry monster with big, kind eyes and a goofy grin appeared at the gate. He wore a bright green bow tie and carried a giant, elaborately wrapped present.

"Happy Birthday, Lily!" the monster boomed, his voice deep but surprisingly gentle. "I'm Barney, and I heard you were having a super-duper party!"

Lily’s friends stared, initially in awe. But then, seeing the friendly monster's smiling face, their initial fears vanished and their worries were all dispelled with a resounding "wow!"

Barney lumbered through the gate, the kids all gathering around him in seconds. He gave Lily a huge hug, nearly squeezing her too tight with affection!

“Wow, that was the best hug ever!” Lily happily exclaimed.

“Do you want to see what I brought you for a present?” Barney said. He handed Lily the giant gift.

With everyone gathering close, Lily tore the colourful wrapping paper off the present to reveal an enormous inflatable swimming pool, shaped like a giant cupcake! The frosting swirls looked so real, they even looked delicious.

"Wow!" the children all yelled in unison. They knew instantly what they wanted to do: spend the final moments of Lily’s party by playing and relaxing in that huge cupcake-shaped pool.

Barney was amazing. He joined in on all the games, although his enormous size made him slightly clumsy at times. He chased after the water balloons, splashing everyone with giggles, played Pin the Tail on the Donkey, missing the donkey, as well, and he even sat on the lawn with Lily and her friends while helping her decorate each slice of her cupcake-shaped cake with frosting flowers and sprinkles.

He also told them the silliest stories about his life as a friendly monster, making everyone burst out laughing, even some of the moms and dads watching from the picnic table.

As the sky grew dark, the party started to wind down. Barney, with a sad face, knew it was time to go.

"Thank you so much for coming to my party," Lily said, giving Barney another hug. "It was the best party ever!"

"You're very welcome, Lily-pad," Barney said, his eyes sparkling. "I had a super-duper time! Remember to always be kind, and never be afraid to be yourself." With that, he waved goodbye, promising to return the following year.

As Barney disappeared through the gate, Lily and her friends knew that their day would not have been a success if it wasn’t for the help and happiness of the friendly monster. Everyone thought they could also now, happily, consider themselves a bit friendly with monsters, too.

Lily’s friends hugged each other goodbye, promising to see each other again very soon. The air filled with shouts of “See you again!” and “Goodbye!” and Lily waved to her departing friends.

Lily’s parents helped to clear up and put things away. Once they had put the finishing touches on the final preparations for the night, her parents were about to tuck her into bed for a long and restful sleep.

After a very eventful day, and after all of the guests had left, Lily sat on the edge of her bed, absolutely exhausted but filled with joy. She held her fluffy unicorn in her arms and smiled.

"Mom, Dad," she said, yawning, "that was the best birthday party ever."

"We're so glad you had fun, sweetie," her mom said, tucking her in.

"The friendly monster was great!" Lily exclaimed. "I can't wait until he comes again next year!"

"Well," her dad said with a wink, "you never know what kind of fun the future may bring. Just promise you’ll close your eyes now. Sleep well Lily-pad."

Lily snuggled under her covers, her heart overflowing with happiness. She knew that she would always remember her special day with the best of friends, the most fun games, the perfect cake, and most importantly, the friendly monster who made her party truly unforgettable. Her best birthday yet, and it felt like it. She slowly drifted off to sleep, dreaming of fluffy purple fur, giant cupcake pools, and more fun than she could imagine. She was so, so happy.
