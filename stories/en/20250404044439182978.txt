<title>The Cool Brother Playing Games With The Little One.</title>
<body>
"Ready to play, Lily-pad?" boomed Leo, his voice echoing slightly in the freshly painted playroom. He was twelve, all lanky arms and legs, his hair perpetually sticking up at odd angles. Lily-pad, his little sister Lily, who was six, skipped into the room, her bright pink dress a blur of motion.

"Yes, Leo! Yes! What are we playing?" she squealed, her eyes sparkling.

Leo grinned, showcasing a missing front tooth. "Well, I was thinking… a treasure hunt! But not just any treasure hunt. This is a Super-Duper Secret Spy Treasure Hunt!"

Lily clapped her hands. "Ooh! Spy stuff! I love spy stuff!"

"Excellent!" Leo declared. He gestured dramatically. "First, we need our spy names. I shall be… Agent Blaze!"

Lily tilted her head. "Agent Blaze? Cool! I wanna be Agent… Sparkle!"

"Perfect, Agent Sparkle!" Leo said with a wink. "Now, every good spy needs a mission brief. Let's get to it!"

He pulled out a sheet of paper from behind his back – a piece of cardboard covered in scribbled drawings and bold lettering. He cleared his throat and began to read, his voice low and serious, imitating the way he'd heard spies in movies.

"Mission Objective: To locate the Golden Goblet! This valuable artifact is hidden somewhere within the premises. You, Agent Sparkle, will be assisting me, Agent Blaze, in this crucial mission. The clues are hidden, requiring both cunning and bravery. Failure is not an option. Understood?"

Lily saluted, her eyes wide with concentration. "Understood, Agent Blaze!"

Leo beamed. "First clue, Agent Sparkle! The first clue resides where stories begin and end." He handed her a folded piece of paper. "Go find it!"

Lily, already feeling like a real secret agent, raced off, her pigtails bouncing. Leo chuckled and watched her disappear, then quietly pointed to himself and mouthed the word, "Easy!" He knew she would find it quickly. He had taped the clue to the back of their family book collection in the living room.

After a few minutes, Lily returned, triumphant. "I found it! I found it!" She waved the new clue in her hand.

Leo took the paper. "Let's see what we have." He unfolded the clue, reading aloud: "Seek the source of endless chatter, where food finds its happy after, by the shimmering metal, the answer awaits!"

Lily looked confused. "Endless chatter? Happy after? What does that mean, Leo?"

"Hmm," Leo stroked his chin, feigning deep thought. "Think, Agent Sparkle, think! Where do we often eat? Where is food… finished?"

Lily's face lit up. "The kitchen! And the shimmering metal is the… the fridge!"

Leo grinned. "Precisely! To the kitchen, Agent Sparkle!"

They dashed off to the kitchen. Lily, her mission clear in her mind, marched straight to the refrigerator. On the fridge door, stuck with a magnet shaped like a sparkly star, was the next clue.

"Excellent work!" Leo praised. "Let's see… 'Where sunlight paints a vibrant hue, secrets wait, both old and new.'"

Lily pondered, her gaze sweeping around the kitchen. The sun was shining through the window, painting the kitchen with a warm light. Then she looked upwards at the window box where their mum grew plants and a small decorative ornament was on display.

"The window box! The ornament must have the clue!"

She reached up and carefully took the small painted figurine that lived in the window box and underneath, on a piece of paper folded up tiny was the next clue. They both inspected the location and could see a tiny space between two layers of plastic on the ornament and agreed to open that next.

The next clue read: "In the land of dreams, where shadows play, the Golden Goblet hides away!"

Lily's face fell a little. "Dreams? Shadows? I don't know where that is."

Leo knew this was slightly trickier. "Think, Agent Sparkle, think! Where do we go to dream? Where do the shadows hide?" He took a deep breath as he knew the answer.

Lily paused, then her eyes widened. "Our bedroom! My bedroom and your bedroom!"

"Exactly!" Leo cheered. "We're almost there!"

They raced upstairs to their bedrooms. Leo's room was predictably messy, a collage of posters, comics, and scattered clothes. Lily’s room was neat and organised, adorned with pictures and toys.

"You go search in your bedroom, Agent Sparkle," Leo instructed. "I'll search mine."

Lily scurried to her room and meticulously looked for her clue. "I found it! I found it!" she squealed again, moments later, holding up a piece of paper attached to one of her stuffed toys. Leo also gave the signal that he had found the clue and was close behind.

Leo gave Lily the last part of the clue. "Here we go…" Agent Blaze read, "Look beneath a bed, for what dreams reside."

This was the last clue. It had been set by Leo and he quickly indicated they needed to look under the beds.
The beds where relatively simple, Leo's bed could be difficult to crawl under and to investigate but Lily was more nimble.
Under her bed, Lily saw a glittery, golden goblet, shimmering brightly. "I found it! The Golden Goblet!"

Leo followed. He reached under the bed and picked up the Golden Goblet, then spun around, making his voice boom "Mission accomplished! Agent Sparkle, you've saved the day!"

Lily threw her arms around his legs. "Yay! We did it! We're super spies!"

Leo ruffled her hair. "Absolutely. Now, let's celebrate with… snacks! I'll raid the fridge."

They ran back downstairs, laughing, and began the best part of the mission, to find snacks.

After their snack break, and before they decided to leave the playroom, Leo thought of more things.
"Wait a second Agent Sparkle, I have a better mission for you. We will be investigating… toys. As you know there are numerous toy collections for children here!" Leo said with a slight pause.

Lily beamed back. "Yay! More secret mission adventures!"

Leo began to walk round the playroom, pointing to the toy sections. "We must make sure they are all okay. Let us start with the soft toys."

Lily eagerly agreed. They made their way over to the shelf that included all their stuffed toys.

Leo gestured towards the group of soft toys and spoke to his sister. "The first step, my lovely agent, is to begin the process of the 'Cuddle Test' This involves holding and analysing how the toy feels!"

They spent an hour playing with soft toys. Leo then instructed his sister.
"Agent Sparkle! Your expertise is needed elsewhere. In the next toy section, we must analyse the 'Toy car' collection! Prepare your skills."

They spent an hour exploring toy cars, testing how they rolled. Leo then asked her to give ratings out of ten for them. Lily loved rating them.

Then it came to their final session of the toy investigations. Leo said "Our final session, the 'Toy Train'. This involves inspecting train journeys! We must ride them!"
They ended their session riding the toy trains. The time spent had created laughter and excitement, and was the best session!

"Our mission here is complete. The playroom is a great space!" Leo grinned at his sister.
"My favourite play area ever!" Lily shouted with much energy.

"Now, Agent Sparkle, I think you've earned a promotion. You are now…" He paused for dramatic effect. "Agent Sparkle Supreme!"

Lily gasped. "Agent Sparkle Supreme! Wow! Thank you, Agent Blaze!" She bounced on her toes.

"And now, Agent Sparkle Supreme," Leo said, "what shall we do next?"

Lily considered, then smiled. "Can we… can we build a really, really tall tower with the blocks?"

Leo chuckled. "Absolutely, Agent Sparkle Supreme. To the block tower, it is!"

They spent the rest of the afternoon happily building, their combined laughter filling the playroom as they collaborated to construct the tallest tower imaginable, and a bond that was far stronger than the Golden Goblet would be if they had tried their new adventure alone!
