<title>The Sleeping Beauty and the Sleepy Dragon</title><body>Once upon a time, in a kingdom filled with giggling brooks, fluffy sheep, and gingerbread houses with gumdrop roofs, lived a princess named Poppy. Princess Poppy, however, was not known for her grace or her tiaras. Oh no! Princess Poppy was famous for one thing: she was the Sleepiest Princess in the Whole Wide World.

She could fall asleep mid-sentence, while eating a strawberry, or even during a particularly exciting game of hide-and-seek. Her royal advisors despaired. Her royal chef worried that Poppy would miss the delicious apple pie he baked every Tuesday. And the King, her father, was constantly poking her gently with a feather, just to check if she was still breathing (which she always was, thanks to her loud, rumbling snores).

One sunny afternoon, a dreadful thing happened. A wicked witch, whose name was actually Mildred (but she preferred "Malificenta," which sounded much more dramatic), placed a terrible sleeping curse upon Poppy. The curse meant that Poppy would sleep for one hundred years unless she was awakened by a… *drumroll* …dragon!

Now, the kingdom did not have any dragons, or so everyone thought. You see, dragons were mostly extinct, except for one, a very, very sleepy one named Sparky. Sparky lived in a cave at the top of Mount Snore, and he was known, not for fire-breathing, but for… well, for sleeping.

Sparky slept constantly. He slept through earthquakes, thunderstorms, and even a particularly loud brass band that once tried to play outside his cave. He slept so soundly that he often missed mealtimes, which was a shame because Sparky loved toasted marshmallows (though he rarely remembered to toast them).

The King was beside himself! "Find a dragon!" he roared, causing his crown to wobble precariously on his head. Knights rushed off in all directions, shouting, "Dragon hunt! Dragon hunt!" It sounded a bit silly, even to the bravest knight.

Sir Reginald, a knight known more for his kindness than his courage (he once helped a squirrel find its acorns), was given the important task of searching. He was sent on a quest – up Mount Snore! Armed with a rusty sword (more for show than for actual dragon-fighting) and a basket of particularly tasty jam sandwiches (for sustenance, of course), Sir Reginald began his arduous climb.

The path was steep and winding, filled with loose pebbles and grumpy goats. Sir Reginald puffed and panted, his chainmail digging into his shoulders. After what felt like an eternity (though was probably only a few hours), he reached the top. There, nestled in a cave, snoring louder than a thousand trumpets, was Sparky.

Sparky was a sight to behold. He was a vibrant emerald green, with mismatched wings (one was slightly bigger than the other) and a long, swishy tail. But what was most remarkable was his snoring! It vibrated through the very mountain, shaking loose small rocks and causing a family of birds to fly away in a panic.

Sir Reginald cleared his throat. "Um, hello?" he said, trying to sound brave.

No response. Sparky kept snoring.

Sir Reginald tried again, a bit louder this time. "Excuse me, Mr. Dragon? Wake up, please?"

Still nothing. The snores continued. Sir Reginald sighed. This was going to be harder than he thought. He remembered the jam sandwiches. Perhaps a tempting scent would do the trick?

He opened his basket and took out a sandwich. The sweet smell of strawberry jam wafted through the air. He tentatively held the sandwich near Sparky’s nose.

Suddenly, Sparky’s eyelids twitched! His nostrils wiggled. Then, with a mighty yawn that almost swallowed the cave, he opened his eyes. They were the color of honey, and rather sleepy looking.

"Mmm…smell… strawberry…jam…?" mumbled Sparky, his voice thick with sleep.

"Indeed!" replied Sir Reginald, pleased. "I have a sandwich right here, just for you, if you would be so kind as to… er… wake up?"

Sparky blinked slowly. "Wake…up…? For…jam…?"

"Yes!" said Sir Reginald encouragingly.

Sparky thought about it for a moment. Then he looked at the sandwich. The jam gleamed temptingly. "Okay," he mumbled, finally, "but just…for… a…little…bite…" And then, with a groan, he managed to sit up, knocking over a pile of mismatched socks in the process.

Sir Reginald, with a relieved smile, carefully held the sandwich for Sparky. Sparky took a giant bite, jam dribbling down his chin. He chewed thoughtfully.

"Mmmm…very…good…jam," he mumbled, his eyes already starting to droop again.

"Now, listen," Sir Reginald said quickly, before Sparky could fall back asleep. "There's a problem. Princess Poppy is under a sleeping curse, and only a dragon can wake her."

Sparky’s eyes opened a little wider, the word "curse" seeming to register. He slowly scratched his chin with a claw. "A…curse…? And…Poppy…? Sounds… important…"

"Very important!" exclaimed Sir Reginald. "She needs you!"

Sparky pondered this for a few seconds. He glanced at his mismatched wings. He glanced at Sir Reginald, who was looking rather worried. Then he looked longingly at the remaining half of the sandwich. "Will…I…get…more…jam…?"

Sir Reginald, in his desperation, nodded enthusiastically. "All the jam you can eat!"

This seemed to do the trick. Sparky, with a mighty heave (and another smaller yawn), lumbered to his feet. "Okay!" he said, suddenly sounding more awake, though still a bit sleepy. "Let's…wake…this…Poppy…up!"

And so, Sir Reginald and Sparky, the sleepy dragon, began their descent from Mount Snore.

When they arrived at the castle, they found Princess Poppy fast asleep in her grandest bedroom. She was curled up under a pile of silk blankets, her face serene, though her mouth was slightly open, and a tiny dribble of drool was visible on the pillow.

Sir Reginald looked at Sparky, who was looking at Princess Poppy. Sparky yawned again.

"So…" began Sir Reginald, unsure of what to do next. "How…do…you…wake…her?"

Sparky thought for a moment, then he looked at the sleeping princess and yawned once more. "Hmm…usually…a…big…sneeze…"

"A sneeze?" Sir Reginald repeated, confused. "But dragons can't sneeze, can they?"

"Oh, I…can," replied Sparky sleepily. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and, with a gigantic effort, he puffed out his chest. "Ah…AH…ACHOO!"

A cloud of glittery, sparkly, slightly smelly dragon-sneeze filled the air! It was followed by another tiny plume of pink jam which had, rather unfortunately, erupted from Sparky’s nose with the force of his sneeze.

The force of the sneeze blew across the room. It ruffled Princess Poppy's hair. It tickled her nose. And, suddenly, her eyes fluttered open. She stretched, yawned, and sat up.

"Mmm…apple…pie…?" she mumbled, still a little dazed.

"Poppy!" cried the King, rushing into the room, followed by the worried chef holding a newly baked pie, just in case. "You're awake!"

"I…am?" Poppy blinked in confusion. She looked around the room. "And…who's…the…green…thing?" She pointed at Sparky, who was attempting to wipe jam from his nose with his claw.

The King beamed at his daughter. He explained the whole story: the wicked witch, the sleeping curse, Sparky the dragon, and the importance of the sneeze and jam!

Poppy listened patiently, then she yawned again, which prompted her to glance at the delicious looking apple pie. The royal chef promptly placed it on her bed table, and Poppy instantly began eating, mid-explanation of the whole scenario!

Sparky, of course, got his jam sandwiches and promptly proceeded to go back to sleep. This time, he had plenty of fresh and fragrant towels under him, just in case of future dragon sneezes and more jam incidents.

Princess Poppy, cured of her curse (for now), was no longer the Sleepiest Princess in the Kingdom, but she did still enjoy a good nap. She often invited Sparky to afternoon tea (with lots of jam sandwiches), and he’d promptly fall asleep again, causing the table to occasionally collapse under his snores, though that didn't worry anyone.

The King learned to always have a spare feather on hand, just in case Poppy started falling asleep in meetings. The gingerbread houses continued to have gumdrop roofs. The sheep kept on being fluffy, and life in the kingdom was, as usual, full of giggles, a little bit of chaos, and, best of all, plenty of naps, shared by the Sleepy Princess and her newly discovered friend, the Sleepy Dragon. And Sir Reginald got a promotion for saving the kingdom and making sure there would always be enough jam. The end.
