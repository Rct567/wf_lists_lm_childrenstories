<title>How a Tiny Dragon Saved the Garden</title><body>
Barnaby Button, a tiny dragon no bigger than a house cat, lived in a garden overflowing with the most spectacular vegetables imaginable.  Giant pumpkins the size of small cars sat nestled amongst broccoli florets taller than Barnaby himself, and peppers hung from vines like brightly coloured Christmas ornaments.  It was a garden of culinary dreams, a veritable paradise for a hungry dragon, or so Barnaby thought.

The problem wasn't a lack of food, though.  Oh no, Barnaby could have feasted on a feast of fresh fiddleheads, juicy zucchini, and crunchy carrots. The problem was... well, it was the *other* dragons.

You see, Barnaby was, unfortunately, part of a rather boisterous clan.  His brothers, Bartholomew and Barry, were fearsome, fire-breathing behemoths who considered munching on a whole field of tomatoes a delightful afternoon snack. Their appetites were legendary, and Barnaby, with his tiny paws and surprisingly delicate palate, was often overlooked when the delicious garden bounty was shared.

So, Barnaby devised a plan.  He needed to prove his worth, to show the others that even a small dragon could be useful, maybe even… *valuable*. He consulted with Miss Primrose, the wise old sunflower, who had seen many a dragon arrive and depart the garden over the years.

"A grand display of prowess is required," Miss Primrose declared, her petals rustling with amusement.  "Something spectacular, something... *unique*."

Barnaby pondered. He could roar, he could breathe fire (though his flame would likely resemble a flickering candle), he could certainly not fly like his brothers (it felt like a tiny weight had decided to stick permanently to him).  The problem was... being a tiny dragon wasn't the most useful thing for grand displays of prowess in a garden overflowing with deliciousness.

Then, Barnaby had an idea. He remembered Mrs. Pepper's tales of the enormous, hungry slugs that loved to feast on the juicy leaves of the most succulent lettuce plants. The slugs, these slimy, disgusting little menaces, were a menace to Barnaby's favorite leafy greens.

His plan was bold, perhaps even a little unconventional.  He would not be a mighty, fearsome destroyer like his brothers. He would be... a slug-hunting hero!

Barnaby gathered a handful of colourful pebbles. He meticulously arranged them, forming a dazzling, intricate mosaic pattern on a patch of moist earth next to the precious lettuce. Then, using his surprisingly nimble tiny claws, he created a series of tiny, winding tunnels, designed to catch the slugs.  His tunnel system, brilliantly constructed using minuscule stones, pebbles, and some very small earthworms, was an architectural marvel.

Word of Barnaby's clever little construction spread quickly throughout the garden.  The grumpy hedgehogs, the buzzing bees, and even the chirping crickets flocked to observe Barnaby's magnificent project.  They were convinced it would fail utterly.  Slugs were crafty little critters, after all, they could disappear with uncanny grace and speed.

But Barnaby was unfazed. He waited patiently.  Soon, a glutinous, greyish slug, almost as large as Barnaby himself, wriggled its way out onto the mosaic path. The tiny dragon, ready and waiting, dashed from one of the tunnels to the other with impeccable timing. With a surprising burst of speed, the little hero scooped up the slug.

And another, and another! Barnaby was like a tiny vacuum cleaner, effortlessly collecting slugs and putting them into a neat little collection area that he'd prepared (a tiny box he'd fashioned). His tiny but determined heart pounded with satisfaction.

The garden buzzed with admiration. The other dragons, initially skeptical, were utterly amazed. Bartholomew, Barry, and even Barnaby’s notoriously uncaring older sister, Beatrice, watched in awe.  They had never seen such a resourceful use of cunning, never seen a small dragon make such a big difference.

Barnaby, with a contented little squeak, finally proclaimed, "I have saved the garden, magnificent and amazing lettuce leaves!"

The other dragons, once again with hungry stomachs, were more receptive to Barnaby’s new title. They discovered a new respect for the tiny dragon who had not just saved the garden from the slug problem but from the potential of starvation for the mighty dragons.


Barnaby became the Slug-Sweeper, the Protector of the Produce. His reputation spread far beyond the garden, becoming a source of admiration for other tiny dragons in need of a plan, or just some vegetables for dinner. And in his little, surprisingly productive way, Barnaby Button, the tiny dragon, had proved to everyone that size wasn't everything – especially when it came to saving the garden, and stomachs!
