<title>The Cloud That Wanted to Be a Rock</title>
<body>
Barnaby wasn't like the other clouds.  He wasn't a fluffy, cotton-candy white, nor a majestic, storm-grey.  Barnaby was a pale, almost translucent lavender, and he longed, desperately, to be a rock.

Every morning, as the sun peeked over the misty mountains, Barnaby would drift lazily across the sky, feeling utterly out of place.  The other clouds, with their playful swirls and dramatic billows, seemed to have a purpose. They floated together in happy families, chasing each other through the azure canvas. Barnaby, though, just drifted, a lonely lavender wisp in a vast blue.

"I want to be solid," he’d sigh, his lavender form shimmering slightly in the sunlight. "I want to be sturdy, unyielding. Like a granite mountain."

The other clouds would giggle. "Oh, Barnaby," they’d chuckle. "You'll never be a rock. You're a cloud. It's your nature to float, to wander. To feel the breeze and watch the world go by."

But Barnaby couldn't shake the feeling. He yearned for the unshakeable strength of a rock, the permanent presence of a mountain.  He watched the towering peaks, their sharp edges etched against the sky, and dreamed of being one with them.

One day, a wise old owl, perched on a branch overlooking the valley, heard Barnaby's whispered lament.  Hooty, the owl, with his knowing eyes, hooted softly. "Barnaby," he said, his voice like the rustle of autumn leaves, "you are not meant to be a rock. But perhaps you can find a way to be grounded, while remaining beautiful."

Barnaby looked up, puzzled.  "Grounded?"

"Yes," Hooty said.  "You want the solidity of a rock, its steadfastness. But clouds, too, can have enduring qualities. Consider the way a cloud can shelter a valley from a storm, the way it reflects the golden rays of the setting sun."

Barnaby thought about it.  He thought about the way a rainbow, a temporary but stunning display of colour, could form amidst the shifting clouds.  He realised that clouds, in their transience, held beauty that a static rock couldn't.

That night, as Barnaby drifted above the sleeping valley, he noticed something special.  A small, hidden grove of wildflowers was nestled in a secluded hollow.  These wildflowers, he realised, were grounded but also beautiful, blooming and changing with each season.

An idea sparked in Barnaby's lavender heart.  Instead of trying to be a rock, he would be a cloud that could *nourish* the land. He’d become a cloud that could provide, a cloud that held water, ready to sprinkle life onto the thirsty earth.  He began to imagine himself not as a single, floating object but as part of a vital system.  A vital, fleeting system that was crucial to the earth's health.

He shared his idea with the other clouds. They listened attentively, impressed. Barnaby, they discovered, had a knack for helping nourish the land; his gentle rains brought prosperity to the farms and wildflowers alike.

From then on, Barnaby wasn’t a lonely lavender wisp. He became a vital part of the weather patterns, his delicate form providing life-giving moisture to the fields and forests below. He learned that permanence wasn’t the only form of strength, that transience could be beautiful and purposeful. He learned that a cloud could be a rock in a different way; a nurturing, benevolent provider. He became a protector, the guardian of the sky above.  

And though he wasn't a rock, Barnaby felt more grounded than ever, more secure than he had ever felt before. He wasn't just a cloud; he was a beautiful cloud, a vital part of the world, a cloud who nourished the life of the land.  The cloud that wanted to be a rock, had instead, become a unique and precious part of the sky. He was Barnaby, the nurturing cloud, the constant protector, admired and cherished by the earth below.  And that, he realized, was strength enough.
