<title>Celeste the Cat and Her Curiosity About Colorful Rainbows</title><body>
Celeste was a fluffy, white cat with eyes like melted sapphires. She lived in a cozy cottage nestled beside a babbling brook, in a valley filled with whispering willows and fields of wildflowers. But more than anything, Celeste loved looking at the sky. Every morning, she’d sit on the windowsill, her nose twitching, and watch the sun paint the world with light. She'd follow the fluffy white clouds as they drifted by, imagining them as giant cotton balls or playful sheep.

One day, after a particularly heavy rain, something magical happened. Celeste was still curled up in her favorite sunbeam when the sky began to clear. Patches of blue peeked through the departing clouds, and then, a magnificent arch appeared. It was a rainbow, a vibrant bridge of color stretching from one end of the valley to the other.

Celeste had heard whispers about rainbows. The old, wise owl, Professor Hoot, had once mentioned them, saying they were “painted by the sun after a tearful farewell.” Celeste, being a cat of deep curiosity, tilted her head. What did “tearful farewell” mean? And why were the colors so bright and cheerful if it came from something sad?

She pressed her nose against the glass, her whiskers brushing the cold surface. The rainbow captivated her. She watched, mesmerized, as it held its brilliant shape for what felt like forever. Then, slowly, the colors began to fade, until it vanished completely.

“Oh!” Celeste exclaimed, her tail flicking with disappointment. She knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her fluffy chest, that she had to learn more about rainbows.

She decided to seek out Professor Hoot. The professor lived in an ancient oak tree at the edge of the forest, his home filled with dusty books and scientific instruments.

Padding quietly through the dewy grass, Celeste reached the enormous oak. She looked up, her sapphire eyes searching for Professor Hoot's home. The entrance was a small, perfectly round hole in the tree trunk.

“Professor Hoot?” she called, her voice a gentle purr.

A moment later, the wise old owl poked his head out, his large, intelligent eyes blinking. "Ah, Celeste! What brings you to my humble abode?"

Celeste explained her fascination with the rainbow, asking all sorts of questions. “Why does it appear, Professor? Why are there so many colors? And what does it mean when you said it's from a 'tearful farewell'?”

Professor Hoot listened patiently, his head bobbing thoughtfully. When Celeste was finished, he hooted softly. “Well, little Celeste, the rainbow is a beautiful spectacle, a dance between sunlight and raindrops. The sun's light is made up of all the colors, but we usually can't see them separately. But when sunlight passes through raindrops, it bends and separates into those wonderful colours.”

He then explained how each color had a name and what the order was: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Celeste tried to memorize them, repeating them softly under her breath.

“As for the 'tearful farewell',” Professor Hoot continued, "the rain often accompanies the sun. The sun’s light shines and interacts with the water. In that sense, there could be a feeling like the rain is leaving and the sunshine returns after a cry. It's nature’s way of reminding us of beauty even after the storm."

Celeste’s sapphire eyes widened. She understood a little better, but she still felt a tiny pang of sadness associated with this idea. She remembered how sometimes her own tears would stream down her face when she missed her mother who lived many valleys away.

“So, it's like the rainbow is born from both sadness and joy?” she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

“Exactly,” said Professor Hoot, gently. "It’s a symbol of hope and beauty emerging from what feels difficult." He nodded, seeming pleased that Celeste was picking up such complex ideas.

That night, back in her cottage, Celeste found herself staring at a collection of brightly colored pebbles that she had collected on her adventures. She arranged them in an arc, trying to recreate the rainbow she had seen. As she looked at her miniature rainbow, she realized something. The colors were even more vibrant because she'd witnessed a real rainbow. Each pebble was a small reminder of that fleeting wonder.

The next day brought another heavy downpour. Celeste, remembering what she had learned, didn't hide inside her cozy cottage. Instead, she went and sat by the brook, her tail wrapped around her paws, and watched the rain fall. She imagined the sunlight preparing itself to perform its colourful magic after the storm ended.

She sat and watched and listened. She felt a small, sad tug in her chest as the wind blew the raindrops around her face. Then, just as Professor Hoot had described, the sun began to emerge, pushing through the dark, rainy clouds.

And there it was! Another rainbow, brighter and more vibrant than the first. This time, however, something felt different. Celeste wasn't just captivated by the colors; she felt a warmth spreading through her, a connection to something larger than herself.

She purred softly as the rainbow spread, her sapphire eyes wide. Remembering Professor Hoot's words, she understood that the rainbow represented not only the beauty of the colors but also hope. It was a reminder that even after moments of sadness, something beautiful and vibrant could emerge.

Celeste closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and embraced the colours.

As time passed, Celeste continued to learn and grow. She realised that life was like a rainbow; some moments would be filled with radiant colors and joy, and some moments would be dark, rainy and perhaps sad. But even in the darkest of times, Celeste knew the promise of a rainbow, of beauty waiting to appear.

She befriended other animals, sharing her knowledge of the rainbow and the lessons she had learned. She shared it with the squirrels who chattered in the trees, the rabbits who hopped through the fields, and the deer who came to drink from the brook.

She understood that sadness was a natural part of life, and it wasn't something to fear. Because from sadness, joy and beauty would always follow. Just like a rainbow that could only show its colors once the rain fell.

Celeste never lost her curiosity about rainbows. She’d always watch for them after a rainstorm, remembering the feeling of warmth in her chest as she witnessed their magnificence. And every time she saw one, she’d purr with happiness, remembering Professor Hoot's lesson. The rainbow wasn’t just a pretty sight; it was a promise of hope, a symbol of resilience, a reminder that even after the 'tearful farewell', beauty always returns. It was a perfect picture of life for Celeste. And so, she loved watching the clouds roll by, patiently awaiting the dance of sun and rain, the performance of the rainbow and the moment in which she could celebrate the world's perfect colour.
