<title>The Rainbow Fish Who Wanted to Change Color</title><body>Once upon a time, in the shimmering, blue ocean, lived a very special fish. This wasn’t just any ordinary fish, oh no! This was the Rainbow Fish. He was the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean. His scales shimmered with every color imaginable: ruby red, sapphire blue, emerald green, sunshine yellow, and amethyst purple. He sparkled and gleamed as he swam, catching the sunlight and sending rainbows dancing all around him.

The other fish in the sea were in awe of the Rainbow Fish. They would gather near him, watching him glide by, admiring his dazzling beauty. “Oh, Rainbow Fish, you're so magnificent!” they’d whisper. “We wish we had scales like yours!”

Now, the Rainbow Fish knew he was beautiful. He knew the other fish admired him. But, secretly, he wasn't entirely happy. He felt…different. He felt like he didn't quite belong. He loved the attention, yes, but he also longed to blend in, to be just like the other fish. The other fish had simple, single-colored scales – usually shades of silver, grey, or blue. He wanted to be plain and simple too.

One day, a little clownfish named Coral swam up to the Rainbow Fish. Coral was small and playful, with bright orange and white stripes. "Rainbow Fish," she squeaked, "can I have just one of your sparkly scales? I want to shine like you!"

The Rainbow Fish scoffed. "Give you a scale?" he said, turning his back to Coral. "What for? So you can be as pretty as me? No way!" He wasn’t used to sharing, and he certainly wasn't willing to give up any of his precious, sparkling scales. They were what made him special, after all. He swam away, leaving Coral looking sad and bewildered.

The news of the Rainbow Fish's selfishness spread throughout the reef. The other fish started to avoid him. They stopped admiring his beauty. They wouldn’t play with him or swim near him. The Rainbow Fish, used to being the center of attention, was suddenly all alone.

He swam around, searching for someone, anyone, to talk to, but the other fish scattered whenever they saw him coming. He felt a terrible pang of loneliness. He missed the chatter, the playful games, the feeling of being part of the group. He hadn't realized how much he'd relied on the companionship of the other fish.

One morning, feeling especially gloomy, the Rainbow Fish decided to swim far away from the reef. He swam past towering coral castles, past schools of shimmering tuna, and into the deep, dark ocean. Finally, he came to a dark, gloomy cave. He hesitated at the entrance, afraid of the darkness within.

"Hello?" a raspy voice croaked from the shadows.

The Rainbow Fish, startled, swam closer. Out of the gloom emerged a wise old octopus, with eight long arms and a pair of knowing eyes. Her name was Oona.

"Who are you?" asked Oona, her voice soft and understanding.

"I... I'm the Rainbow Fish," he replied, his voice barely a whisper. "But everyone hates me."

Oona nodded slowly. "I've heard. Your beauty has made you… lonely."

"I want to be like the other fish," confessed the Rainbow Fish. "I want to change my colors. I want to be… ordinary."

Oona chuckled, a sound like the rustling of seaweed. "Changing your colors won't solve your problem, little fish. Your problem is your selfishness. Beauty, like all things, is best when shared. Go to the little fish and give each of them one of your shimmering scales. You'll find joy in sharing."

The Rainbow Fish was taken aback. Give away his precious scales? But…they were all he had! He was sure he’d feel even lonelier without them! He didn’t want to change; he just wanted things to be different. He couldn't comprehend the octopus’s wisdom. But still, he had nothing to lose.

He hesitated, thinking about all those shimmering scales he would have to part with, but then he slowly nodded. He knew what he had to do, so he slowly turned and headed back to the reef. He began to swim towards the reef and when the other fish saw him they quickly turned to escape. “Wait! Please wait!” the Rainbow Fish cried.

Slowly, tentatively, the other fish turned around.

"I… I've been a fool," the Rainbow Fish admitted. He looked at Coral. "Coral, will you please come closer?"

Coral, a little scared, swam forward. The Rainbow Fish carefully pulled off one of his shimmering, sapphire blue scales and gave it to her. "Here," he said. "Take this. Please."

Coral’s eyes widened with wonder. She carefully took the scale, and it sparkled like a tiny jewel in her hand. She looked at the Rainbow Fish, and a huge smile appeared on her face.

The other fish watched in amazement. The Rainbow Fish, who was once so proud and aloof, was finally sharing!

One by one, the Rainbow Fish gave away his shimmering scales. He gave one to a grumpy old grouper, who surprisingly softened when he received it. He gave one to a timid little angelfish who now looked even more beautiful. He gave one to a speedy little tuna. He gave them all one.

Each fish received a scale and thanked the Rainbow Fish. It was difficult giving them up at first, he lost his once dazzling, colourful sheen, but the joy on the faces of the other fish erased any selfish thoughts of loss. They no longer avoided him; they swam around him, chattering excitedly. They finally seemed to understand that the Rainbow Fish, with fewer shimmering scales, was still a beautiful fish.

And though he now had fewer shimmering scales, he was happier than he had ever been before.

The once selfish Rainbow Fish was finally accepted, and in that moment, understood what real beauty meant. It wasn't about the sparkling colours; it was about kindness, generosity, and friendship.

The fish all played together, racing each other, sharing stories, and laughing. They realised that sharing a little of what you have can bring greater joy than owning it all.

The Rainbow Fish was still beautiful, but now, his beauty was different. It was the beauty of a kind heart, of a generous spirit, and of true friendship. He realized that sharing his beauty made it even more precious, because now it was shared with everyone he cared about.

As he swam among the other fish, their colorful scales shimmering alongside his, he was no longer alone. He had friends, he had companions, and he finally, truly, belonged. And that, he realized, was the most beautiful thing of all. He had his scales, and the joy that brought. He had the love from others and shared this in return. He was a simple, sharing, sparkling, and wonderful fish. And everyone was pleased to have him as part of their underwater world, even if he was a little less rainbow, and a lot more colourful.
