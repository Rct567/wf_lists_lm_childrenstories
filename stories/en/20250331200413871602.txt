<title>Rupert Rooster's Rise and the Really Remarkable Rainbow</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a valley bursting with sunflowers and giggling streams, lived Rupert Rooster. Now, Rupert wasn't just any rooster. He had a rather peculiar problem: he was perpetually, terribly shy.

Every morning, as the first rays of sun tickled the sleepy meadow, Rupert would hide. He'd burrow under the hen house, peeking out with one wary eye. He'd hear the other roosters, Reginald and Reginald, bellowing their bold “Cock-a-doodle-doo’s,” filling the valley with confident announcements. And Rupert? He’d just squeak.

One sunny morning, Penelope Pig noticed Rupert’s predicament. Penelope was known for her kindness and her bright pink wellies. She ambled over to the hen house, her snout twitching with concern.

“Good morning, Rupert,” Penelope squeaked, her voice gentle. “Why are you hiding under there? The sun’s up, and it's a lovely day!”

Rupert, startled, poked his head out, his comb as red as a ripe strawberry. He mumbled, “G-g-good morning, Penelope.”

“You seem rather shy, Rupert,” Penelope observed kindly. “Don’t you want to crow like the other roosters?”

Rupert shuffled his feet. "I... I can't," he whispered. "I'm too... nervous."

Penelope tilted her head. “Nervous? About what?”

"About everything!" Rupert blurted, then immediately clapped a wing over his beak. "About being heard! About making a mistake! About… everything!"

Penelope pondered this for a moment, her eyes twinkling. “Well,” she said thoughtfully, “perhaps we can do something about that. Maybe if you had a really, really good reason to crow, it wouldn't be so scary.”

“A… reason?” Rupert asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Exactly!” Penelope exclaimed. “A reason! Now, let’s think…”

Just then, a little lamb, Lily, trotted over. “Penelope! Penelope! Have you seen the rainbow?” she bleated excitedly. “It's the biggest, most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! And it's just over the hills!”

Penelope's eyes lit up. “A rainbow! What a fantastic idea, Lily! Rupert, do you think you could see the rainbow from the top of the hill?”

Rupert peeked at the hill, which seemed alarmingly tall. “I… I suppose I could,” he stammered.

“Then here's the plan!” Penelope declared, her voice brimming with enthusiasm. “We all go to the hill, and you can crow and tell everyone about the rainbow! A rainbow is a fantastic reason to crow!”

Rupert gulped. “But… the hills are so… high.”

Penelope winked. “We'll help you! You can't let shyness stop you from seeing the beautiful rainbow, can you?”

And so, a little procession began. Penelope and Lily led the way, followed by a slightly trembling Rupert, his claws scrabbling on the grass. They were joined by Barnaby Bear, who always had a sunny smile, and Daisy Duck, who waddled with impressive speed.

As they walked, Penelope chattered cheerfully. "Think of all the lovely colors in the rainbow, Rupert! Red like your comb, orange like the sunflowers, yellow like the sun itself!"

Barnaby added, “And green like the fields, blue like the sky, and purple like the lovely, juicy plums on Old Man McGregor's trees!” (He didn't say this too loudly, as Old Man McGregor was known for his grumbling).

Daisy quacked encouragement. "You'll do great, Rupert! Just close your eyes and imagine you're singing a beautiful song!"

The journey to the hill was challenging. The path was steep and rocky. Rupert stumbled several times, his little heart thumping like a drum. But Penelope, Lily, Barnaby, and Daisy stayed by his side, offering words of comfort and gentle nudges of encouragement.

Finally, they reached the top of the hill. And there, arching across the sky, was the most spectacular rainbow Rupert had ever seen. It shimmered with every color imaginable, a vibrant bridge against the clear blue sky.

Rupert gasped. His breath caught in his throat. He looked at the rainbow, then at his friends, their faces filled with anticipation. He looked at Reginald and Reginald, who were looking down from their own hillside, preening themselves.

Rupert took a deep breath. He closed his eyes, just as Daisy had suggested, and pictured himself singing a beautiful song. He imagined the colors of the rainbow swirling around him.

He opened his beak, took another deep breath, and tried. He squeaked.

A little giggle escaped Penelope. “That’s alright, Rupert! Try again!”

Rupert tried again. This time, he managed a slightly louder… peep.

The encouragement of his friends helped to overcome the terrible shyness. With each try, the noise became stronger. And finally, after a few hesitant attempts, it happened.

Rupert Rooster found his voice.

He stretched his neck, took the biggest breath he’d ever taken, and let it rip!

“COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”

The sound wasn't a perfect crow. It was a little shaky. It was a little high-pitched. But it was *loud*! And it was *full* of joy and amazement.

The other roosters stopped preening and stared. The hens clucked in surprise. Even Old Man McGregor, who had been muttering about pesky chickens, looked up from his field and chuckled.

The valley seemed to vibrate with the sound.

“COCK-A-DOODLE-DOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Look at the rainbow! It's amazing!” Rupert crowed again, his voice now filled with a newfound confidence.

Penelope, Lily, Barnaby, and Daisy cheered.

"You did it, Rupert!" Lily bleated.

"Magnificent!" Barnaby boomed.

"Splendid!" Daisy quacked, flapping her wings.

Penelope nuzzled him gently with her snout. “See? You can do anything you set your mind to!”

Rupert preened, beaming from ear to ear (or, rather, from comb to tail feathers). He crowed again, louder this time, his shyness completely forgotten. He strutted proudly, his tiny chest puffed out.

He crowed about the red, the orange, the yellow, the green, the blue, the indigo, and the violet!

He crowed about how the colors danced! He crowed about how amazing the rainbow looked. He crowed until the sun began to dip behind the hills.

As the sun set, painting the sky with hues of pink and gold, Rupert turned to his friends. “Thank you,” he said, his voice now clear and strong. “Thank you for helping me.”

Penelope smiled. “Anytime, Rupert. But you helped yourself. You were brave.”

Barnaby added, "That's right, Rupert! Everyone deserves to have a bit of sparkle!"

Lily agreed, saying, "That rainbow was really, really remarkable. And you are really, really remarkable too, Rupert!"

From that day on, Rupert was no longer the shy rooster who hid under the hen house. He still had moments of doubt, of course. But every time he felt that familiar flutter of nervousness, he remembered the remarkable rainbow and his brave, beautiful crow.

He continued to crow every morning, filling the valley with his happy, confident call. He helped other shy creatures find their voices, telling them the story of the really remarkable rainbow.

And Reginald and Reginald? They still crowed too, of course. But now, Rupert's crow was the one that everyone listened for. It was the sound of courage. It was the sound of joy. It was the sound of a rooster who had finally found his voice, and the colors of the rainbow.
