<title>Henry and the Lost City of Books</title><body>
"Wake up, sleepyhead!" chirped a voice.

Henry groaned, pulling his covers over his head. "Go away, Barnaby," he mumbled. Barnaby was a tiny, fluffy, robin-like creature who was always far too cheerful, especially at dawn.

"But Henry," Barnaby insisted, fluttering closer, "Today's the day! Remember? The day we explore the Whispering Woods!"

Henry peeked out from under his covers, his eyes finally focusing on Barnaby, perched on the edge of his bedside table. "The Whispering Woods? That's what you said yesterday and the day before that."

"And today is finally the day to believe!" Barnaby declared, puffing out his chest. "Professor Willowbrook left a map! And riddles! And… and… BOOKS! Lots and lots of books!"

Henry's ears perked up. "Books?" He sat up, his drowsiness instantly fading. Professor Willowbrook, an eccentric old scholar who lived in a crooked cottage on the edge of town, was famous for his collection.

"Yes!" Barnaby chirped. "He wrote about the Lost City of Books! Hidden deep within the Whispering Woods! Apparently, it's a city made entirely of books!"

Henry was now completely awake. The idea of a city made of books was simply magical. He bounced out of bed, eager to embark on the adventure. "Show me the map!"

Barnaby, in a flurry of wings, led him to the kitchen table where a parchment map lay spread out. It was filled with fantastical drawings, winding paths, and cryptic symbols. "Professor Willowbrook’s directions!" Barnaby announced proudly.

"Okay," Henry said, tracing a finger along the map. "First, we go past Old Man Fitzwilliam’s pumpkin patch…"

"And beware the grumpy scarecrows!" Barnaby warned.

"...Then across the babbling brook..." Henry continued, ignoring Barnaby's embellishments, "...through the whispering trees... And… solve the riddle of the singing stone!"

"The riddle of the singing stone!" Barnaby echoed excitedly. "That's the key!"

They packed a knapsack with snacks, a magnifying glass, and, of course, a book – just in case they needed a reference guide. As they set off, Henry couldn't shake off the thrill of the adventure. The Whispering Woods loomed before them, promising secrets and, hopefully, the Lost City of Books.

As they passed Old Man Fitzwilliam’s pumpkin patch, the scarecrows, with their stitched-on smiles and button eyes, certainly looked grumpy. "Stay close, Henry!" Barnaby squeaked.

"Don't worry," Henry reassured him, keeping a close eye on the scarecrows. They hurried past, reaching the babbling brook without any trouble.

The Whispering Trees, however, lived up to their name. As they walked, the leaves rustled and swirled around them, seeming to whisper secrets. Henry could almost make out words carried on the wind.

"Listen closely," Henry said. "Maybe the trees will help us with the riddle."

They reached a clearing and there, in the center, was a large, grey stone that hummed with a soft, melodic tune.

"The Singing Stone!" Barnaby chirped. "But where's the riddle?"

Etched onto the stone's surface, in elegant script, was an inscription:

*I have cities, but no houses.*
*I have mountains, but no trees.*
*I have water, but no fish.*

"Hmm," Henry said, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "This is a tough one." He read it aloud a few more times. Barnaby hopped excitedly around him, offering his own (rather nonsensical) guesses.

"Is it a cloud, Henry? No, clouds can't have cities… or mountains… or… anything!" Barnaby flew into a momentary fit of exasperation before landing, defeated, on a nearby mushroom.

"Think, think," Henry muttered. He looked around at the trees, the brook, the whispering leaves. What could possibly fit the riddle? He glanced at the knapsack, and his gaze rested upon the book tucked inside. Suddenly, it struck him!

"Barnaby, I know!" he exclaimed, grabbing the book. "The answer is… a map!"

Barnaby’s eyes widened. "A map! Of course! A map has cities, mountains, and water, but they’re all drawings!"

Henry beamed. "Exactly!" He placed the open book on top of the singing stone. The stone’s humming grew louder, and a bright, golden light surrounded them. A narrow path, paved with smooth, cobblestone, suddenly appeared where there had been only undergrowth.

“The path is open!” Barnaby cheered. “The riddle is solved!”

They followed the path. The Whispering Woods grew quieter, and a sense of wonder washed over them. The cobblestone path led them down, deeper, and deeper, eventually, to an arched doorway carved into a hillside. Above the doorway, a sign read: “The City of Everlasting Stories.”

"We made it!" Barnaby squeaked, hopping on Henry’s shoulder as they approached the doorway.

They cautiously stepped through the archway and gasped. They had entered a magnificent city, unlike anything Henry had ever imagined. Every building was made of books! Towers rose high into the sky, constructed from neatly stacked volumes of various sizes and colours. Streets were lined with tomes, forming pathways between the literary structures.

"Wow," Henry breathed. "It's... it's amazing!"

"Amazing!" Barnaby echoed. "It really is made of books!"

They began to explore, their eyes wide with wonder. There were buildings devoted to poetry, history, fantasy, and science. Some of the books stood upright; others had been cleverly shaped into walls, arches, and windows. Even the lampposts were formed of carefully arranged scrolls!

“Look! The Library of Legends!” Barnaby announced, pointing towards a towering building with open windows in every wall. "I hear there is a book of every tale!"

They went to the Library. Its interior was equally astonishing, lined with bookshelves that stretched all the way to the top. The scent of old paper and ink filled the air.

As they wandered through the library, browsing the shelves, they saw someone familiar. It was Professor Willowbrook, sitting at a large oak table and engrossed in a particularly thick volume. He looked up, and a warm smile spread across his face.

"Welcome, Henry and Barnaby," the professor said. "I knew you would find your way here eventually."

"Professor Willowbrook!" Henry exclaimed. "This place… it’s incredible!"

"The Lost City of Books," the Professor said, with a twinkle in his eye. "A haven for stories. A place where imagination has no limits. Tell me, did you enjoy the journey to get here?"

“We did,” Henry said. "Especially the riddle of the singing stone."

“Yes, a good riddle always unlocks the most fantastic adventures,” Willowbrook agreed. He motioned towards the open chair next to him. "Please, join me. I am on the very edge of a brand new adventure myself and am ready for a good set of companions. Are you both up for it?"

"What are you reading?" Barnaby, never missing an opportunity to be inquisitive, peered at the open book.

"The book of untold stories," the Professor replied with a grin. "All sorts of journeys await! But, before we start, I have a riddle for you. Just to see if you are worthy." He cleared his throat.

"I have no voice, but I can speak to your soul. I have no wings, but I can take you to any world. I have no life, but I can bring characters to life. What am I?"

Henry paused to consider it. He thought about all the wondrous tales in front of him. He thought about the excitement in the professor's eyes, and even in Barnaby's, and smiled.

"A book," Henry said proudly.

"Quite right, Henry!" Willowbrook exclaimed. "That, my friend, is a magnificent book. Ready to explore, I believe?"

Henry nodded enthusiastically. Barnaby took his spot atop Henry's shoulder and began a merry dance. With a friend by his side, the promise of a journey filled with adventure ahead, Henry was perfectly ready to start another exciting story. The Lost City of Books was more than just a city. It was a doorway. And Henry was delighted to open the page and step through it, to whatever wonderful tale waited on the other side.
