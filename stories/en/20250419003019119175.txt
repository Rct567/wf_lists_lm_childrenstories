<title>A Little Piglet and the Muddy Puddle</title><body>Once upon a time, nestled in a cozy green valley, lived a little piglet named Percy. Percy was a very cheerful piglet. He loved to oink, he loved to roll around in the hay, and most of all, he loved to play. Percy had bright, twinkling eyes and a curly little tail that wagged whenever he was happy, which was most of the time.

Percy lived with his family on Farmer Giles' farm. There was Mama Pig, a large, gentle pig with a kind smile. Papa Pig, a strong and sensible pig, always had a helpful tip or a funny story to share. And there were Percy's siblings, Penelope, Prudence, and Peter, each with their own unique personalities and love for adventure.

The farm was a wonderful place to live. There were fields of sweet-smelling clover, tall, shady trees, and a bubbling stream where the ducks loved to splash. But Percy had one special place he adored more than any other: the big, wonderful, squelchy, muddy puddle.

The muddy puddle was located near the old oak tree at the edge of the farm. It was formed after every rainfall, and it was Percy's favourite spot in the whole world. It wasn't just any puddle; it was a super-duper, magnificent mud-bath!

Every sunny morning, after a breakfast of yummy pig slop, Percy would scamper out of the pigpen and head straight for the puddle. He’d wiggle his little nose, take a deep breath, and squeal with delight. Then, he'd leap in!

One bright and sunny morning, Percy woke up extra excited. He bounced out of his little bed of straw, oinking a happy tune. "Time for the mud puddle!" he squealed.

He raced past Mama Pig, who was busy arranging a pile of carrots for lunch. "Good morning, Percy," Mama Pig called, "Be careful and don't get too muddy."

Percy oinked in response, too busy to stop. He dashed past Papa Pig, who was checking the fence. “Off to the puddle already, are we?” Papa Pig chuckled.

Percy didn’t even reply; he simply waved his curly tail, a blur of happy motion, and continued his race towards the old oak tree.

When he reached the puddle, he stopped in his tracks. He couldn’t believe his eyes! The puddle was different. It was… smaller. It hadn’t rained for a few days, and the puddle was starting to dry up. The mud was hard and cracked around the edges.

Percy’s ears drooped slightly. His tail stopped wagging. He sniffed the air sadly. This was a problem. He couldn’t possibly have a proper mud-bath in such a small puddle. He wouldn't even be able to *roll* in it properly!

He thought about running back to his siblings, Penelope, Prudence and Peter, and asking them what they thought. But he knew they were busy chasing butterflies, or eating acorns, or following Farmer Giles around. He couldn't really disturb them with his sadness. He just had to sort this out.

Percy sat beside the little puddle, twiddling his snout. He wriggled a bit, trying to get the best idea possible. The hot sun beat down on him, and he began to feel a little sticky and warm. Then he had an idea! It popped right into his little piglet head, a thought as sparkly as a dewy cobweb.

He decided he needed more water! But where could he find water? The stream was far away, and it was too big to get on his own. The only things nearby were the chicken coop, where he thought he might find some small puddles from the dripping of their water. But if he went over there the chickens would think he was wanting to eat their food, or might bite at him! And they were not happy!

So, Percy started to wander and ponder. He thought of the little watering trough where Farmer Giles watered his animals. It might be too big too and he definitely couldn't reach it to try and fill his puddle, even if it was accessible.

He continued to trudge, but did not give up. After what seemed like a long time to him, but was actually only a few minutes, he noticed Farmer Giles. He was standing by the pump at the well, using it to fill the big water tanks.

Percy thought, *Farmer Giles! Maybe he can help!* He oinked as loud as he could, and trotted toward the farmer. "Oink, oink!" he called.

Farmer Giles looked down and smiled. "Well, hello there, Percy," he said kindly. "What's got you all worked up this morning?"

Percy explained about the little puddle and how it wasn't muddy anymore, and how he really wanted a mud-bath. He oinked and squealed with such enthusiasm that Farmer Giles couldn't help but chuckle.

"Well, Percy," Farmer Giles said. "That sounds like a problem we can solve!"

Farmer Giles grabbed a large, empty bucket. He walked over to the well and pumped it full of water. Then, holding the bucket carefully, he walked back towards the old oak tree, with Percy trotting excitedly at his heels.

Farmer Giles slowly poured the water into the little puddle. The muddy puddle instantly grew, and the water started to soften the dry earth. Percy watched, his eyes sparkling. He could already imagine the glorious mud-bath that awaited him!

Farmer Giles poured several buckets of water until the puddle was perfectly sized. He straightened up, smiling at Percy.

Percy didn’t hesitate for a moment. With a joyful squeal, he launched himself into the wonderfully wet, muddy puddle. He splashed and squelched, he rolled and wiggled. He was in piglet heaven!

He kicked his hooves up in the air, sending muddy water flying. He snorted with pure happiness, creating little mud-bubbles. He wallowed and wiggled, covered from snout to tail in delicious, glorious mud.

Farmer Giles smiled and watched Percy with amusement. “Looks like someone’s having a good time,” he said.

Percy, between splashes and rolls, managed a cheerful oink. He was too busy enjoying himself to give Farmer Giles a full reply.

After a long time spent enjoying his bath, Percy slowly emerged from the puddle. He was covered head-to-toe in thick, brown mud. He looked at Farmer Giles, who was now sitting under the old oak tree, relaxing in the shade.

Percy shook himself and a cloud of mud flew into the air. “Thank you, Farmer Giles!” Percy oinked, beaming. He waddled towards Farmer Giles and then plopped down contentedly on the grass beside the old man, giving a little happy grunt.

Farmer Giles patted Percy on the back. "You're welcome, Percy," he said. "Sometimes all you need is a little help to have a perfect day."

Percy closed his eyes, enjoying the warmth of the sun and the smell of the fresh grass, next to the Farmer.

He thought of his Mama Pig, and Papa Pig, and Penelope, Prudence and Peter. He realized they had not been able to play today. Mama Pig had had all those carrots to arrange! Maybe he could ask them to share his puddle once it dried up a bit.

Percy took a deep breath and felt an extraordinary feeling of satisfaction. The world felt bright and new. The air smelled clean and inviting, the sound of birds filled the air. He also knew he’d helped make himself, and his day, the most special it could be. It made his happiness complete!

As the sun began to dip low in the sky, painting the valley in warm colours of orange and gold, Percy eventually climbed out of the puddle again. This time, it was time for dinner, and of course, sleep. Percy knew the value of getting to bed early, and all the other pigs would, too.

He looked back at the puddle, a beautiful circle of mud. It had been the best day ever. He had learned that sometimes problems can be fixed with a little bit of help, and that it's always better to seek help and assistance.

Percy headed towards the pigpen. The little piglet waddled to sleep, full of muddy contentment, ready to face the new adventures the next day might bring. And as he drifted off to sleep, Percy knew, with absolute certainty, that he had the best, muddiest, and most wonderful life a little piglet could possibly imagine. The end.
