<title>The Shimmering Rainbow appearing after rainfall events.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and beside a babbling blue river, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily had bright, curious eyes and a smile as warm as the summer sun. Her best friend was a fluffy white cloud named Cumulus. Cumulus wasn't just any cloud; he loved to rain! He loved making the world fresh and sparkly.

Lily and Cumulus spent their days playing together. They'd race across the sky, Cumulus puffing and changing shape like a giant cotton candy, and Lily would giggle, pointing out the funny animals and objects she saw in his form. Sometimes, Cumulus would sprinkle the land with gentle raindrops, and Lily would run outside, twirling in the drizzle with her arms outstretched.

One sunny afternoon, as Lily was skipping through a field of daisies, Cumulus started to rumble. Dark, grey clouds gathered overhead, blocking out the sun. Lily, knowing what was coming, ran giggling towards her little cottage, her boots already muddy with anticipation.

“Rain, rain, come again!” she shouted, laughing as big drops of water began to fall.

Cumulus, true to his word, poured down a delightful shower. The world transformed. The green fields turned even greener, the river glistened, and the daisies bowed their heads in the gentle rain. Lily stayed indoors, listening to the drumming on her windowpane. She loved the way the rain smelled, a fresh, earthy scent that made her feel cozy and content.

After the rain had danced and splashed for a little while, it began to slow. The grey clouds started to drift away, leaving patches of bright blue sky peeking through. The sun, shyly at first, peeped out, warming the earth.

Lily, eager to explore, dashed outside as soon as the last raindrops stopped falling. The air smelled wonderfully clean and fresh. She stood on her porch, gazing at the world around her, when she gasped.

“Cumulus!” she cried.

Cumulus, now fluffy and white again, drifted lazily across the sky. But something else was there, something amazing and beautiful. Stretching across the sky, like a giant, colourful bridge, was a rainbow!

Lily had seen rainbows before, but she never failed to be amazed. It was a curved arc of brilliant colours: a vibrant red, a happy orange, a cheerful yellow, a lush green, a cool blue, a deep indigo, and a bright violet. They were perfectly aligned, creating a beautiful spectacle.

“Wow!” Lily whispered, her eyes wide with wonder. “It’s so beautiful!”

Cumulus, sensing Lily’s excitement, gently puffed and changed shape a little, as if bowing towards the rainbow.

Lily remembered her grandpa had taught her about rainbows, he had said: "A rainbow always appears after the sun shines after the rain." Grandpa always told her these special moments, such as the rainbow's, were special gifts, and to not waste them. She thought about this, how the sun, and Cumulus (the rain), made the rainbow appear.

Lily had an idea! She would run to her friends' houses and show them. She skipped along the muddy path, careful not to fall.

Her first stop was her best friend, Tom. Tom loved to build things, like treehouses and toy cars. He was playing in his yard, with his building blocks.

“Tom! Tom! Come quick!” Lily shouted, waving her arms excitedly.

Tom looked up, surprised. "What is it, Lily?"

“Come see!” she called. She pointed towards the sky. "A rainbow! It’s the most amazing rainbow I’ve ever seen!”

Tom, intrigued, ran out and gasped. "Wow! It's beautiful!” he said, staring up in amazement.

They stood together, silent for a moment, appreciating the colours in the sky. Lily had to explain her Grandpa's knowledge about how the rain and sun combined to create the amazing sight.

Next, Lily went to see her friend, Maya, who loved to draw and paint. Maya was sitting in her garden, painting flowers.

“Maya! Look!” Lily exclaimed.

Maya, with a paintbrush in her hand, looked up. "A rainbow!" she exclaimed. “It’s perfect!” She set aside her paints and fetched a new, blank paper. She began to sketch the rainbow, adding details and colours to her drawing.

Lily watched her draw, admiring Maya’s artistic skills. They were joined by Tom as well. The rainbow gave Maya a creative boost, the art began coming easily!

Finally, Lily went to see her grumpy friend, George. George rarely smiled, but he had a good heart. He was sitting by his window, reading a book, probably because the rainy weather made him want to spend more time inside.

Lily hesitated, wondering if George would appreciate the rainbow.

"George!" she called, hesitantly, standing by his door.

George peered out from his window. He mumbled. "What is it now?"

"Look," Lily said softly, pointing toward the sky. "A rainbow."

George stared at the sky. He didn’t say anything at first. Then, very quietly, he said, “It's… it's pretty.”

Lily smiled. Even George could appreciate the beauty of a rainbow!

The three friends all huddled, admiring the amazing rainbow that was in the sky. Lily was reminded of her Grandpa, and his words.

As they looked, Lily pondered the idea: why was the rainbow always there after the rain, only sometimes? And only with the sun?

They all continued admiring the rainbow, which gently faded as the afternoon wore on. The colors became less vibrant, the arc thinner. Soon, it disappeared completely, leaving only a clear blue sky behind.

Lily, Tom, Maya, and George all went back to their own pursuits, all smiling with joy at the amazing sight.

Lily returned home, feeling happy and content. She knew the rainbow was a magical gift. It was a reminder that even after the rain, after the grey clouds, there was always beauty to be found. It also taught her that everyone, even George, could find joy in simple things.

That evening, as the sun set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Lily sat on her porch, thinking. Cumulus, in the form of a gentle breeze, whispered through the trees. She felt thankful for her friend, Cumulus, who provided the rain, and for the sun that helped make the beautiful rainbows.

As she went inside to bed, she held onto one thing, for all of her years. Never take anything for granted, from a beautiful flower to a wonderful rainbow! The next day, as she set out, she was hoping for a rainfall event.
