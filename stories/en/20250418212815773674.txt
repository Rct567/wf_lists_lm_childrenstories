<title>The Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes</title>
<body>
Barnaby Button was, without a doubt, the silliest boy in Bumblebrook. His socks rarely matched (one was usually wearing a jaunty little strawberry), he talked to squirrels (who, admittedly, mostly ignored him), and his laugh sounded like a flock of seagulls having a particularly lively argument. He also, and this was the most important part, had a profound fear of bedtime.

Not the actual sleeping part, mind you. Barnaby *loved* sleeping. He was renowned for his ability to fall asleep in a variety of unusual positions: perched on the dog's fluffy tail, half-buried in a pile of cushions, or even, once, balanced precariously on a precariously placed stack of encyclopedias. No, the fear stemmed from the dreaded bedtime ritual.

Each night, after the arduous process of toothbrushing, pajama-donning, and general mayhem-avoiding, his mother would bring out the Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes. It was a large, leather-bound book, filled with elaborate drawings of fluttering butterflies and whimsical verses about sleepy skies and dreams that danced. And every night, Barnaby had to pick a wish from it. And every night, he *hated* it.

He’d much rather play with his toy car collection, or build magnificent towers of building blocks, or, even better, convince his dog, Captain Cluck (a rather un-chicken-like Chihuahua with a serious Napoleon complex), that the world was, in fact, made of sausages. But alas, the Book was the law.

"Right, Barnaby," his mother would chirp, her voice as bright as a freshly polished button, "Time for the Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes! Tonight, what wondrous dream will you choose?"

Tonight’s choices were particularly uninspiring, in Barnaby’s expert opinion. The first, ‘A Sea of Snuggles’, seemed frankly terrifying. Imagine drowning in cuddles! The second, ‘Dancing Dragons Dream’, was immediately rejected. Dragons, to Barnaby, were only cool if they were the size of his thumb and made of LEGOs. The third, ‘Rainbow River Rambles’, sounded... well, a bit damp, to be honest.

“Mmm,” Barnaby mumbled, chin resting on his hand. “Can’t I choose a dream about… sausages?”

His mother chuckled. “I’m afraid not, darling. The book only contains approved dreams, you see. Butterfly dreams. Now, which one will it be?”

Desperate to delay the inevitable, Barnaby began a detailed examination of the illustrations. The Sea of Snuggles depicted a particularly fluffy cloud overflowing with kittens. Ugh. The Dancing Dragons Dream featured fire-breathing, ballet-dancing reptiles. Double ugh. The Rainbow River Rambles looked like someone had sneezed glitter all over a map. Triple ugh.

Suddenly, a tiny, barely noticeable speck of gold glitter on the page caught his eye. It wasn't part of the illustration, it was just… there. Carefully, he prodded it with his finger.

“Mum, what's this?” he asked, his voice suddenly more excited than he’d been all evening.

His mother peered closely. “Hmm. That seems to be a… speck of gold glitter, Barnaby. Did you get into the art supplies again?”

“No! It wasn’t me!” Barnaby protested. “It’s… It’s magical glitter! I can feel it! I bet if I wish on this glitter, I can have any dream I want!”

His mother smiled. She’d seen this tactic before. “Well, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to try, would it? Close your eyes, make a wish on the glitter, and see what happens.”

Barnaby closed his eyes, squeezed them shut with all his might, and whispered his wish. “I wish for a dream where I’m a… a giant jelly bean, rolling through a… a cheese factory! And Captain Cluck can drive a monster truck!”

He held his breath, waiting for the sea of snuggles or the dancing dragons. But instead, he felt a strange tingling sensation. His body felt… squishy?

He opened his eyes, cautiously. He was no longer in his bedroom. He was in a vast, echoing cavern, bathed in a golden light. Everywhere he looked, there were towering vats filled with what appeared to be, unmistakably, cheese. And he was… bouncing. He was a giant, vibrant green jelly bean!

“This is amazing!” he exclaimed, forgetting all his bedtime anxieties. He bounced and jiggled, tasting the air, which smelled wonderfully of cheddar.

Suddenly, a roar echoed through the cavern. Barnaby froze, his jelly bean heart thumping. A monstrous, mud-splattered truck, driven by none other than Captain Cluck, zoomed around a corner! The tiny Chihuahua was wearing a tiny helmet and gripping a tiny steering wheel, his eyes narrowed with furious concentration.

“Bwahahaha! Prepare to be… JELLY BEANED!” Captain Cluck barked, as the monster truck lunged toward him.

Barnaby yelped and bounced faster, dodging giant, cheesy obstacles. He bounced over a pile of particularly pungent Stilton, slid down a ramp made of Monterey Jack, and narrowly avoided being flattened by a wheel of gouda.

The dream was utterly ridiculous, hilariously chaotic, and fantastically fun. He spent the whole time laughing, narrowly escaping cheese-based hazards, and generally causing as much joyful mayhem as possible.

Eventually, exhausted from bouncing and cheese-dodging, Barnaby woke up, back in his bed. The sun was streaming through the window. He sat up, grinning from ear to ear.

“That,” he declared to a sleepy Captain Cluck, curled up at the foot of the bed, “was the best dream *ever*!”

He scrambled out of bed and ran to the Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes. He flipped through the pages, searching for the secret glitter. But it was gone! Vanished without a trace. He looked at his mother who had been alerted by his unusually high levels of excited chattering.

“Did you like your dream?” his mother asked, smiling.

Barnaby beamed. “Yes! It was brilliant! I was a jelly bean, and Captain Cluck drove a monster truck through a cheese factory!”

His mother pretended to be shocked. “Good heavens! You’ll never look at a cheese sandwich the same way again, will you?”

Barnaby shook his head, still chuckling. Then, he pointed to the Book. “Mum, did the glitter really *make* the dream?”

His mother paused, a twinkle in her eye. “Well,” she said, thoughtfully, “the glitter probably gave you a *little* help. But, darling, the magic comes from inside *you*. You see, the best dreams are the ones that are silly and fun, the ones that let your imagination run wild.”

Barnaby thought about this for a moment. It made perfect sense! He realized that he no longer dreaded the Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes, he was happy with them. He now had the choice to make any dream, even the official butterfly ones fun.

From that day on, bedtime was no longer a chore. Barnaby still picked a wish from the book each night, but instead of grumbling, he’d close his eyes, make his wish, and then, with a giggle, let his imagination take over. He no longer needed a speck of magical glitter; he had something even better: his own creative spark.

He had dreams about racing snails in a hot air balloon (surprisingly competitive). He had dreams about tap-dancing penguins wearing top hats. And occasionally, just occasionally, he even had dreams involving Captain Cluck and a cheese factory. The Book of Bedtime Butterfly Wishes was now something Barnaby Button actually looked forward to every single night. He found he never saw the socks as boring after that.
The End
