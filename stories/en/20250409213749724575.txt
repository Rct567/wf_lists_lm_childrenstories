<title>The Lost Puppy Who Found His Way Back Home to His Family</title><body> Barnaby Buttonsworth the Third, or just Barnaby to his very best friends (and there weren’t many), was a puppy with a problem. Not a serious problem, like a leaky paw or a fear of squirrels. No, Barnaby’s problem was he was spectacularly, wonderfully, gloriously... clumsy.

His fluffy, cream-coloured fur was perpetually dusty, not from playing in the dirt, but from accidentally tripping over absolutely everything. A blade of grass? Trip! A shadow? Trip! His own two paws? You guessed it, trip, trip, trip!

He lived in a cosy, slightly wonky, doghouse in a garden bursting with flowers, belonging to the rather eccentric Professor Penelope Parsnip. The professor wasn't really a professor of anything specific, she just collected unusual hats and knew the names of every single dandelion in the neighbourhood.

One sunny Tuesday, Professor Parsnip decided to enter Barnaby in the annual "Best Puppy in the Borough" competition. This was a huge honour! Barnaby, however, wasn’t particularly keen. He envisioned himself tripping over the red carpet, face-planting into the prize-winning petunias, and generally making a complete spectacle of himself.

“Now Barnaby, darling,” Professor Parsnip boomed, adjusting a particularly flamboyant hat with a tiny stuffed parrot perched on top, “you simply *must* practice your ‘Stay’ command! A well-behaved puppy is half the battle!”

Barnaby sighed, his fluffy tail drooping. Staying still was, in his opinion, the most difficult thing a puppy could be asked to do. Especially when there were juicy butterflies to chase, interesting smells to sniff, and rogue tumbleweeds (that sometimes blew all the way from the Sahara Desert, according to Professor Parsnip) to investigate.

During practice, Barnaby, predictably, tripped. He tripped over a rather large gnome statue (Professor Parsnip collected gnomes too) and ended up rolling head over heels into the rose bushes. Rose bushes, as it turned out, had thorns.

"Ouch!" he yelped, wiggling his ears.

Professor Parsnip chuckled. "Oh, Barnaby! You're such a darling calamity!"

The following day, the Great Borough Puppy Show arrived! The sun blazed, the bunting fluttered, and Barnaby felt a distinct wobble in his tummy. He was wearing a rather dashing little bow tie, hand-knitted by Professor Parsnip, of course.

As Professor Parsnip and Barnaby were walking towards the competition area, a particularly energetic Jack Russell Terrier, who seemed to be fuelled by rocket fuel and mischief, dashed past. He was chasing a particularly plump bumblebee. Barnaby, distracted by the flitting black and yellow blur, forgot to watch where he was going.

BAM!

He collided head-first with a sturdy oak tree, sending his little bow tie flying into the branches and his head spinning. When his world stopped rotating, he realised…he was alone. Professor Parsnip was nowhere to be seen. The bustling crowds, the happy dogs, the delicious-smelling hot dog stand (Barnaby adored hot dogs) – all were fading into a blurry mess. He was…lost!

Panic welled up in Barnaby’s fluffy chest. He whined softly, then began to tremble. The nice smells of sausages and other delicious food, combined with the happy chatter of the crowd was making Barnaby's stomach rumble. He was truly lost, and a little bit hungry.

He took a deep breath, reminding himself of Professor Parsnip’s favourite saying: "When in doubt, wiggle your nose and sniff!"

So he did. He wiggled his nose and sniffed. The first thing he smelled was the familiar aroma of roses, the ones he had tumbled into earlier. Then came the enticing scent of…bacon! Ah, nothing like a nice slab of crispy bacon to start a good puppy journey!

He followed the scent, which led him towards a rather jolly-looking gentleman grilling something over a portable barbecue. He was wearing a chef's hat and humming a jaunty tune. As Barnaby approached, the man looked down and chuckled.

"Well hello there, little fella! You look lost. Fancy a bit of bacon?"

Barnaby’s tail wagged so furiously, it almost knocked the chef’s hat off. He got a small strip of sizzling bacon, which he devoured in one happy gulp. The chef then, seeing that he had cheered up the sad puppy, pulled out a map.

"Where do you live, little fella?" the chef asked kindly, but the problem was, Barnaby didn't know! He knew his garden and the funny hat-wearing Professor Parsnip, but he hadn’t the faintest idea how to explain any of that to this very nice, but unfamiliar, chef.

Barnaby’s mind went blank. He whined again. Suddenly, his eyes fell on the chef's little black boots. Ah, they are the same kind as he saw one of his human family wear, his mind was making some leaps in judgement! The man had two hands, a pair of black boots... He began to think, that perhaps he could draw a boot for help, on the ground. He began to paw, slowly writing a boot in the dirt and pointing towards it and back at himself.

The chef looked confused, but then, something sparked in his mind, as he grabbed the little puppy and lifted him.
"Let's go, friend! The best way to find your way back home, is by looking at other dogs". The chef got into his small van and they began a new journey to find a house.

Barnaby had never been in a van before, and it was a very bouncy ride! Barnaby, quite used to being in the air and travelling fast, and still feeling rather lost, was not quite enjoying the view or the movement. The chef had other plans though.

As the day went on, the chef asked at every house with a dog, asking if it was a good puppy's home, which led to a lot of confusion but also some treats, with each door opening with its respective canine neighbour. Finally, they got to a house which reminded him of his own, a lady had a very strange hat on and was walking a fluffy, creamy dog.

The chef began to laugh. “We made it, boy!"

But the best part came now! Barnaby recognized a very familiar smell! And even more so, the scent of Professor Parsnip's special brand of lavender-scented dog shampoo. And there she was, his Professor Parsnip, and a rather agitated-looking gnome (who must have felt lonely without Barnaby).

Professor Parsnip gasped. “Barnaby! You clever, clumsy puppy! Where have you been?” She rushed towards him, scooped him up in a hug so tight, it almost squeezed the fluff right out of him.

"Oh, my darling Barnaby! I've been looking everywhere for you! I was so worried! But who is this?" she enquired.

The chef was more than happy to introduce himself, and even to bring some new bacon treats! Professor Parsnip, after getting him down and after lots of treats and hugs, told the little puppy how to get back safely next time.

"When you get lost, my precious boy, remember to look for familiar smells. The smell of my lavender soap, perhaps? Or, even better, the scent of freshly baked biscuits! Those are hard to resist!"

Barnaby nodded, feeling safe and loved. He learned a valuable lesson that day: even though being clumsy could lead to a bit of adventure (and some exciting bacon snacks), there was no place like home. And as he trotted back through the gate, the rather battered little bow tie was found and tied around his neck once more. The little puppy smiled. He would win that "Best Puppy in the Borough" competition one day…maybe not by winning, but definitely by showing everyone his loving clumsiness!
