<title>Simon Spider's Amazing Web and Catching the Tasty Insects.</title>
<body>
“Good morning, world!” chirped Simon Spider, stretching his eight spindly legs as the sun peeked over the tall, green grass. He was a small, fluffy spider, with a bright, cheerful disposition and a very important job to do: build a web!

“Time to spin!” he announced to the dewdrop that was clinging precariously to his back. “Another day, another masterpiece!”

He scampered to his favourite spot, a sturdy twig that jutted out from a bush overflowing with bright red berries. It was the perfect location - just the right height, with lots of lovely, juicy-looking insects buzzing about nearby.

“Right, first the anchor lines,” Simon muttered to himself, puffing out a tiny cloud of spider-breath. He shot a thin, shimmering strand of silk towards a nearby leaf, securing it with a clever little dab. "Strong and steady, just like me!"

“Whee!” a tiny voice squeaked.

Simon stopped his spinning. “Who said that?” he inquired, his many eyes swivelling around.

“Down here!” the voice squeaked again.

Simon looked down. Sitting on a fat, juicy strawberry was a little ladybug, its shell gleaming with tiny red spots. “Oh! Hello! Are you talking to me?”

“Of course, I am!” giggled the ladybug. “I’m Dot! What are you doing?”

“I’m building my web,” Simon explained, preening a little. “It’s where I catch my… lunch!” He added shyly.

Dot blinked. “Lunch? You eat insects?”

“Well, yes,” Simon admitted. “It’s what spiders do. They are very tasty!"

Dot looked a bit worried. “Oh… I guess I better be careful then.”

“Don't worry, little one,” Simon said, trying to sound reassuring. "I don't usually catch ladybugs, you're not as tasty." He then realized the error of his words. "Well, not that you *aren't* tasty... I mean... I wouldn't eat *you*. You're my friend now! Friends don't eat friends, especially not spotty ones!"

Dot giggled again. “You’re funny, Simon. I like watching you spin your web! It’s like magic.”

“Magic is a good word for it,” Simon agreed, proudly shooting another strand of silk across to another leaf. He then worked on creating a circular structure using several circular lines to make the web stick. "It looks complicated but, well, it’s my job. It's fun actually. Each one of the many lines has to have perfect tension, else everything will fall."

"Wow," Dot breathed. "Are you done yet?"

"Oh no," Simon chuckled. "This is only the beginning! We need to create those sticky lines. The ones that trap the insects. The delicious ones."

He began to spiral inward, laying down sticky threads in a neat, spiral pattern. “The sticky lines are like…super-glue for bugs! They won’t be able to get away!”

Just then, a tiny, buzzing sound filled the air. A small, green grasshopper, no bigger than Simon’s thumb, zipped past him, making a wild, frantic 'fzzz-z-z'.

“Whee! Freedom!” the grasshopper shouted in a high-pitched voice. “No more carrots! No more greens! I’m off on an adventure!”

Suddenly, the grasshopper, in his excited rush, flew directly into Simon’s web! He bounced around, becoming more and more tangled.

“Oh dear,” gasped Dot, covering her eyes with her tiny, red, spotted hands. “Is it…is it lunchtime now?”

Simon paused. He looked at the trapped grasshopper, its little legs flailing desperately. He looked at Dot, her spots all shiny and round, now watching with big eyes. Then he looked back at the grasshopper, at its terrified expression.

"Wait, don't worry," Simon spoke in a calming tone to Dot and the grasshopper. "I have an idea."

He scurried over to the grasshopper and carefully, delicately, began to cut away some of the sticky threads. "Don't worry," he whispered to the grasshopper, "I will get you free. Just stay calm and keep still."

The grasshopper, stunned by this unexpected act, froze. "Uh, thanks?"

Simon kept cutting away at the sticky threads, all of it needing focus and dexterity. It was slow going, and required precise movements to stop him from being caught himself. 

“Why are you… helping me?” the grasshopper finally squeaked, when a considerable portion of the sticky threads had been removed.

Simon stopped his work and shrugged, not saying a word.

"I feel... silly," the grasshopper murmured.

"We all have adventures," Dot responded, offering reassurance.

“I’m not supposed to eat you, but you were being very careless!" Simon explained, still working. "The web took lots of hard work to build.”

Finally, after what felt like ages, Simon freed the grasshopper.

"Oh, thank you, Simon!" the grasshopper exclaimed, hopping once or twice to test its legs. “I…I’m sorry I flew into your web. I was being very foolish. I think carrots sound great right now!”

Simon smiled, happy with the situation now. “That's alright! Accidents happen. And I think I'd prefer a nice beetle today, anyway.”

The grasshopper smiled in relief. "I'm called Jack!"

Dot beamed. "Hi Jack! I'm Dot."

"It is great to meet you," Jack said.

“Are you two friends now?” Simon inquired, happy for the situation, all worked out. He began adding more of his own super-sticky, spiral lines back to his web, a web that was as wonderful as he’d originally thought, only now a little smaller, and slightly out of shape.

Dot and Jack looked at each other. Then they both looked back at Simon and nodded enthusiastically.

"Yes! The very best of friends," Dot declared, rubbing her hands together with joy.

Jack added with great emphasis, "and no more carrots!"

"Maybe," said Simon thoughtfully. "Let us start from fresh with the new, tasty bugs now."

“Then,” Simon announced, as the sun climbed higher, warming the air. “Let’s get back to the main event: tasty insects! Look there! A juicy bluebottle, just heading into the area."

“A beetle, too! A shiny, brown one!” shouted Jack, hopping excitedly.

Dot and Jack watched the activity as Simon spun his lines once more, catching many of the insects to be eaten. They talked to Simon at the same time, as the work took many hours.

As the day wore on, they kept catching insects, eating them happily, and learning about how to live peacefully with each other. The three had developed a very strong bond.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Simon sat on the top of his web, his eight legs comfortably spread. He’d caught a satisfying number of insects. Dot sat beside him, occasionally looking down into the distance, where the stars were slowly coming to light, like the eyes of another species. Jack, with his long, powerful legs, was sat on the grass, jumping up and down to the final beat of the sun, which was fading fast. He had discovered some of the benefits of life on the ground as a grasshopper, in terms of exploring his local areas.

“That was a good day,” said Simon contentedly.

“The best day ever!” agreed Dot, happily.

“Absolutely fantastic!” said Jack, his eyes gleaming with a mixture of sunshine, sunset, and delight.

“And you two are my best friends,” Simon added, feeling warm and fuzzy inside.

Dot smiled, her red shell reflecting the soft glow of the setting sun.

“I knew you wouldn’t eat me,” she said. “I knew you’d want to be friends.”

“Of course!” said Simon. “And tomorrow… more delicious insects, adventures and, well…web-building of course!"

Jack, remembering the earlier events of the day, shook his head, amused. He'd learned many lessons today, of course.
“Let’s have more carrots next time!” he shouted, with a mischievous grin.

The three friends looked at each other, and burst into laughter, knowing this was going to be the start of a beautiful friendship filled with adventure, laughter, and many shared, tasty meals (though not always the same ones). They all slept happily as the gentle night wrapped itself around them. The web, though slightly damaged, shone with reflected moonlight, a testament to the best friends a spider could ever ask for.
