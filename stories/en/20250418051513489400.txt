<title>Meeting a Unicorn in a Forest Glade</title>
<body>
Lily loved exploring. She loved the way the leaves crunched under her boots, the smell of damp earth after it rained, and the feeling of sunshine on her face. One sunny morning, Lily decided to venture into the Whispering Woods, a place she’d always been curious about but hadn’t been brave enough to visit alone before.

Lily was seven years old, with bright, curious eyes and a smile that could light up a room. Her hair was the colour of sunshine, and she often wore a blue ribbon that bounced when she walked. Today, she clutched a small, worn book about animals and a picnic basket filled with apple slices and a sandwich.

As she entered the Whispering Woods, the trees seemed to lean in, whispering secrets to each other in the breeze. Sunlight dappled through the leaves, creating dancing patterns on the forest floor. Lily took a deep breath. The air smelled of pine needles and something else… something sweet and magical.

She walked along a winding path, her boots making soft sounds. She imagined she was a great explorer, charting unknown territory. She opened her animal book, hoping to spot some of the creatures described within. She kept an eye out for squirrels, birds, and maybe even a deer.

After walking for a while, Lily stumbled upon a small clearing. The clearing was circular, filled with the softest, greenest grass she had ever seen. Wildflowers of all colours – red, yellow, purple, and white – dotted the landscape. In the centre of the clearing, there was a small, crystal-clear pond.

Lily gasped. It was the most beautiful place she had ever seen. She carefully placed her picnic basket on the grass and decided to sit down and enjoy her lunch.

As she reached for her apple slices, she heard a soft sound, like the tinkling of tiny bells. Lily looked up, her eyes wide with wonder.

Standing at the edge of the pond, its coat as white as fresh snow, was a unicorn.

It was magnificent. Its coat shone in the sunlight, its eyes were the colour of amethyst, and a long, silver horn spiralled elegantly from its forehead. It dipped its head towards the water, gently lapping at the crystal surface.

Lily was frozen, her breath caught in her throat. She had read about unicorns in her animal book, but she never thought she would actually see one.

Slowly, very slowly, Lily began to move. She didn’t want to scare the unicorn away. She placed her apple slices on the grass, then picked up a large, red flower and offered it to the unicorn.

The unicorn raised its head and looked directly at Lily. Its eyes held a wisdom and a gentleness that made Lily feel calm. The unicorn took a step forward, then another, until it stood directly in front of her.

Lily held her breath.

The unicorn lowered its head, nuzzling the flower Lily held out to it. Then, with surprising delicacy, it took the flower in its mouth, munching on the stem and then, seemingly satisfied, it looked again at Lily.

Lily finally found her voice. “Hello,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I… I didn't know unicorns were real.”

The unicorn tilted its head, as if understanding her words. A soft whinny escaped its lips.

Lily smiled, emboldened by the unicorn's friendly response. She slowly took another apple slice and held it out to the unicorn. The unicorn gently took the apple slice from her hand, eating it with obvious enjoyment.

“What is your name?” Lily asked.

The unicorn lowered its head towards her, as if encouraging her to pet it. Lily reached out her hand, her fingers trembling slightly. She gently stroked the unicorn's velvety soft nose. It was even softer than she imagined. The unicorn closed its eyes, clearly enjoying her touch.

“You’re… you’re so beautiful,” Lily whispered.

The unicorn nuzzled against her, its horn brushing against her arm.

For a long time, Lily and the unicorn just stood together in the clearing. Lily shared her apple slices and her sandwich, which the unicorn, to her great amusement, seemed to enjoy. They watched butterflies dance around the wildflowers and listened to the birds singing in the trees.

Lily learned that the unicorn’s name was Whisper. It wasn’t able to speak in words, but Lily understood what Whisper meant. Whisper communicated with her through soft whinnies, nuzzles, and the gentle touch of its horn. Lily, in turn, talked to Whisper about everything. She talked about her family, her school, and all the things she loved.

As the afternoon wore on, the sunlight began to slant through the trees. Lily knew she had to go home soon. She was sad, but also so very happy that she had met Whisper.

“I have to go now, Whisper,” she said softly. “My mum will be wondering where I am.”

Whisper nudged her gently, as if understanding. Lily took one last look at the magnificent unicorn.

“Will I see you again?” Lily asked.

Whisper bowed its head and then nodded gently. It looked at Lily, nudged her toward a part of the forest path, and with one last look, it trotted gracefully away into the trees, disappearing from sight.

Lily watched until Whisper was out of sight. A warmth spread through her chest.

Lily gathered up her picnic basket, and with a skip in her step, she walked out of the clearing and back along the path, feeling a secret joy she couldn’t quite contain. The trees still whispered in the breeze, but now their whispers seemed to have changed, to be telling a wonderful secret.

As she walked, Lily decided to name the clearing "Whisper's Glade." She knew that she would never forget her meeting with the unicorn.

When Lily reached the edge of the Whispering Woods, she ran all the way home.

The next day, Lily returned to the Whispering Woods. She went straight to the clearing, to Whisper's Glade.

Whisper was there, waiting for her.

Lily ran to Whisper, hugging her new friend. They spent the whole day playing and enjoying each other's company. They played by the pond. Lily sat upon Whisper’s back, the unicorn taking her around the clearing at a gentle pace.

This became a daily routine. Every day, Lily went to Whisper’s Glade to spend time with her friend. They explored the forest together, Lily often sharing the stories from her books.

As the seasons changed, so did the forest. The leaves turned from green to gold and red in autumn, creating a beautiful tapestry on the forest floor. Lily and Whisper enjoyed gathering fallen leaves and creating piles to jump in. They watched as snow fell in the winter, covering the glade in a sparkling white blanket.

Spring brought new life, with flowers blooming and birds singing their cheerful songs. Lily would often weave flower crowns for Whisper, placing them gently on her head. They played amongst the blooming flowers and chased the butterflies around the glade.

Years passed. Lily grew older. She no longer wore the blue ribbon in her hair, but the sparkle in her eyes never faded. Their secret was safely guarded, known only to her and Whisper. The bonds of their friendship were strong. The pair grew up together in the glade, their bond never fading.

One day, many years later, Lily was grown and much older. She was no longer a young girl, her hair now streaked with grey. She returned to the Whispering Woods, with her own grandchild, a young girl with sunshine-blonde hair, clutching her hand.

"This is where I used to play, sweetheart," Lily said, smiling at her granddaughter. "This is where I met a very special friend.”

Lily led her granddaughter through the trees, her heart full of both joy and sadness. She knew the day would come when Whisper would no longer be.

When they reached the glade, it was still as beautiful as Lily remembered. But, Whisper was gone. The once pristine pond now held moss around the sides, the clearing was now much more grown over, but it was clear the magic had not gone.

Lily pointed to the sky, her eyes sparkling like diamonds. "She's always with us,” she whispered.

They spent the day amongst the trees and the glade, sharing Lily's memories. The young girl was spellbound. Lily knew Whisper’s story would be retold, again and again, in the beautiful secret of Whisper’s Glade. And, the glade remained a sanctuary, a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the magic of believing in the impossible. The trees still whispered secrets to the wind, perhaps to future generations who were brave enough to seek the magic, too.

Lily and her granddaughter turned back to the path to go home. In her granddaughter’s hair was a single, white wildflower, perfectly nestled into the little girl's hair.

As they walked home, they both understood the very secret and magical meaning of the glade, and what could still exist there, too. The Whispering Woods would now have two more keepers of the magic of Whisper, and their legend, forevermore.
