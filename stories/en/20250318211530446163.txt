<title>The Mystery of the Missing Toys and the Sleepwalking Scarecrow</title><body>

Barnaby Button, a boy with a head full of giggles and a sock-munching habit, woke with a jolt. Sunlight, that golden-goose egg yolk of the sky, was splodging all over his striped wallpaper. He blinked, his fluffy orange cat, Marmalade, purring a rhythmic rumble against his cheek. But something wasn’t right.

“Marmalade!” Barnaby yelped, sitting bolt upright. “Where's Captain Calico?”

Captain Calico, a pirate teddy bear with a rather fetching eye patch, usually resided on Barnaby's pillow, clutching a plastic cutlass with a ferocity that bordered on alarming. But the pillow was empty. Panic, small but sharp, prickled at Barnaby's nose.

“And…where’s Princess Prudence?” He stammered, glancing at the corner where Princess Prudence, a dazzlingly pink, tiara-wearing unicorn with a rainbow tail, usually galloped across the rug in imaginary races. Gone. Vanished. Poof!

Barnaby scrambled out of bed, tripping over a rogue sock that immediately disappeared under the wardrobe. This was serious. Toys don't just *vanish*. Unless…

“Marmalade, do you think we have a toy-napper?” Barnaby whispered, his voice laced with dramatic suspicion. Marmalade merely blinked back, yawned a yawn that could swallow a small mouse, and started to knead his paws. Unhelpful cat.

He rushed downstairs, the urgency of a seasoned detective pounding in his tiny feet. He burst into the kitchen where his mum was humming a tune that sounded suspiciously like she was trying to catch a rogue marshmallow in her tea.

“Mum! Princess Prudence and Captain Calico are gone!” he blurted, eyes wide with worry.

Mum, a woman known for her calm acceptance of all things bizarre (including Barnaby's penchant for wearing mismatched wellington boots indoors), simply raised an eyebrow. "Gone where, Barnaby? Perhaps they've decided to take a holiday?"

"A holiday? But…toys don’t go on holidays! Unless…unless someone is taking them on a holiday *against their will*!" Barnaby's imagination was running wild, picturing a dastardly villain (probably with a mustache and a pointy hat) bundling his precious toys into a suitcase, possibly involving a train.

Mum, sensing the gravity of the situation, sighed dramatically. "Alright, detective. Let's see if we can solve this case of the vanishing toys. Where did you last see them?"

Barnaby thought hard, wrinkling his nose and getting a speck of toast crumb lodged in his eyebrow. "Well, last night… I built a magnificent fortress of cushions…Captain Calico was defending it, and Princess Prudence was…was…" He trailed off, struggling to remember. "She was… probably… eating rainbows.”

Mum chuckled. "Right. Let's check the fortress, shall we?"

They examined the now-dismantled cushion fort, leaving no fluffy surface unturned. No pirate teddy bear. No rainbow-munching unicorn. They even checked under the sofa, where dust bunnies of impressive size lurked, whispering tales of lost socks and dropped crisps. Nothing.

Barnaby's bottom lip began to quiver. "This is terrible, Mum! This is the worst mystery since the case of the missing jammy dodger!”

Just then, a particularly loud squawk came from outside. It was Horace, the garden crow, who, to Barnaby’s mind, sounded more like a particularly grumpy seagull. He was perched on the scarecrow, who stood stiffly in the middle of their garden, dressed in his usual patchwork trousers and straw-stuffed coat.

“Maybe Horace knows something,” Barnaby suggested hopefully.

They crept out into the garden. Horace, however, only glared at them with beady black eyes and pecked at a particularly shiny button on the scarecrow’s coat. The scarecrow, normally a silent observer of garden happenings, suddenly swayed. And then…he began to shuffle.

Not in the graceful, dancer-like shuffle you might expect from a scarecrow. This was a jerky, disjointed, and frankly, rather alarming shuffle.

“Mum!” Barnaby yelped, clutching her hand. "He's...he's sleepwalking!"

And it wasn’t just shuffling. The scarecrow was walking *toward* their shed, his straw-filled arms outstretched as if seeking a particularly unusual hug.

Barnaby, fuelled by the potent mixture of fear, intrigue, and the burning desire to solve the mystery of his missing toys, cautiously followed the scarecrow. His mum trailed behind, looking more amused than worried. Marmalade, sensing adventure, abandoned his sunbathing spot and joined the investigation, his fluffy tail twitching with excitement.

As the scarecrow reached the shed, he fumbled at the door, the sound of straw rustling loudly. He pushed it open, stumbled inside, and disappeared.

Barnaby and his mum exchanged glances. This was getting weirder by the minute.

With his Mum holding the flashlight (she always had a flashlight, you never know when you might need it, according to her!), Barnaby bravely crept into the dimly lit shed. Cobwebs, like ghostly streamers, brushed against his face. The air was thick with the scent of old wood and garden tools.

And then, in the corner, illuminated by the beam of the flashlight… they saw him.

The scarecrow. Still shuffling. But…

Clutched tightly in his straw-stuffed arms was Captain Calico. And balanced precariously on his head, held in place by what appeared to be a well-placed strand of straw… was Princess Prudence.

“But… how?” Barnaby breathed, utterly baffled.

Just then, the scarecrow stopped shuffling. His head tilted. A squeaky voice, barely audible above the creaks and groans of his wooden frame, came from his mouth.

"Where... are...the…marshmallows…?"

Mum gasped. Barnaby stared. Marmalade, finally realizing that nothing interesting was going to happen, decided to sharpen his claws on a nearby rake.

"He…he's sleep-talking!” Mum declared, her eyes wide with sudden understanding. "Remember last week, Barnaby, when we made those marshmallow treats? The scarecrow must have overheard us!”

Then it hit Barnaby. The marshmallow treats! They'd left a bag of them in the shed, ready for the next baking session. And Captain Calico and Princess Prudence… They’d always loved marshmallows.

The whole mystery became clear: in his sleep, the scarecrow had heard the delicious memory of the marshmallow stash, he'd wandered into the shed. Finding his way to his destination in his state of subconscious travel. The toys must have been dropped, picked up in a state of delirious somnambulism, perhaps thinking the scarecrow might take them to the promised land. The land of marshmallows!

Barnaby gently took his toys from the scarecrow's arms and held them. “He was…dreaming of marshmallows!” he announced, relief washing over him like a particularly frothy wave. “He must have heard us talking about them, and sleep-walked to find some!"

They carefully escorted the scarecrow back to his post in the garden, carefully smoothing his coat and tucking the straw back into his hat. They returned to the shed and retrieved the bag of marshmallows and Barnaby was so thrilled he had to get straight to baking, so they worked together and made sure the scarecrow would get his tasty marshmallows later, with no sleepywalking required.

“But why would he want the toys?” Barnaby asked, still puzzled.

“Maybe,” Mum said, a twinkle in her eye, "he just wanted someone to share his marshmallow dreams with."

And that, Barnaby decided, made perfect sense. He gathered Princess Prudence, Captain Calico, and a bag of miniature marshmallows and they proceeded to enjoy the baking while awaiting for the scarecrows return. As he bit into a fluffy baked marshmallow, Barnaby decided that even though mysteries could be scary at first, sometimes all it takes is a bit of understanding, a sleepwalking scarecrow, and, of course, a few, or rather, a whole bag of marshmallows, to make everything right. And that, Barnaby thought, was a rather sweet ending to a rather silly mystery. As it turned out, later that evening, under the moon, the scarecrow, upon awaking was pleased to find the whole bag of marshmallows, with a sign that read 'enjoy!'.

The End
