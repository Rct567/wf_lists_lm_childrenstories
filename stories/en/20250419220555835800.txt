<title>When Wishes Came True Everyday</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and a sparkling blue river, lay the village of Evergreena. Life in Evergreena was pleasant enough, filled with the usual joys and occasional hardships that children encountered. But what set Evergreena apart, what made it a village spoken of in hushed tones with wide-eyed wonder, was a secret known only to the youngest residents. It was the secret of the Wishing Well.

Deep within the whispering woods, where sunlight dappled through the leaves and the scent of pine filled the air, stood an ancient, moss-covered well. Unlike the wells that provided water for washing and drinking, this well shimmered faintly, almost as if holding captured starlight. Legend said that on any day a child pure of heart, and with a genuine wish, could cast a coin into its depths and that wish would be granted. But this wasn't just a one-time phenomenon. In Evergreena, the Wishing Well granted wishes every single day.

The story, as told to children, was that the well's magic worked on a subtle system of 'need'. A child didn't simply *desire* something; their wish had to stem from a true need, a longing of the heart. If the wish was based on simple greed or vanity, the well remained silent.

The most excited about the well's secret was a young girl named Lily. Lily was a freckled child with bright, curious eyes and a boundless love for adventure. She possessed a gentle nature and was known for her kindness towards both people and creatures great and small. She was the first child of the village to stumble upon the secret, finding the well when she was lost after chasing after a playful rabbit one afternoon. From that moment on, she visited the well every day.

Initially, Lily's wishes were modest. One day, she wished for her kitten, Mittens, to no longer be scared of thunderstorms. The next morning, Mittens purred contentedly through the loudest rumblings, nestled close to Lily's feet. Another day, she wished for a basket full of warm bread to feed the hungry squirrels she often saw, and a basket promptly appeared, brimming with crusty loaves.

Word slowly, and inevitably, spread amongst the children of Evergreena. Soon, there was a queue by the woods, a hushed air of anticipation growing daily. At first, their wishes were as pure as the magic itself. Little Timmy, whose family couldn't afford new boots, wished for a pair to keep his feet warm. Little Elsie, who had lost her favourite doll, wished for a replacement. And so, new boots appeared, and a new doll, looking exactly like the beloved one, sat upon her pillow.

But as time passed, something started to change. The children started becoming bolder in their wishes. "I wish I had a mountain of candy!" one day went through the children's whisperings, the wish almost immediately resulting in a large quantity of sweet treats being made. And on the next day, the well's generosity was taken even further, when a voice cried out, "I wish to be the strongest of all," only to have the boy's appearance grow visibly bulkier.

At first, the wishes were met with cheers and amazement, but it soon caused discord. Suddenly, every child wished for new things. The wishes started becoming selfish. They began wishing for the most elaborate toys, for endless sweets, for grand adventures. The spirit of cooperation and sharing that had always been the heart of Evergreena began to fade. Bickerings broke out. The village shops quickly struggled to find the goods they needed, which resulted in resentment among families, and the value of their simple community started to disintegrate.

The effect on Evergreena was immediate and unsettling. The children, initially thrilled, became unhappy. There was always *more* to wish for. Possessions didn't bring lasting joy, and the endless stream of toys, treats, and exciting experiences only served to create dissatisfaction. The laughter that once filled the village squares faded, replaced by arguments and envy. The children's initial contentment was consumed by greed.

Lily watched with growing sadness. She understood that the well’s power, used irresponsibly, could corrupt the very heart of their home. She noticed, also, a new absence among the villagers. Even those who seemed to take their good fortune lightly began disappearing on a near daily basis. It was rumoured that the adults were going away, never to return.

One crisp autumn morning, Lily, heartbroken by what she saw, decided to visit the well again. She walked into the woods, past the increasingly overgrown paths where once her and her friends would meet. She reached the old well. The well, as always, shimmered invitingly. She reached into her pocket, pulled out her last coin, and took a deep breath.

This time, Lily didn’t wish for something for herself. She had everything she needed. Instead, she wished for her friends and family to understand the true value of what they had, and to rediscover the meaning of kindness and generosity. Her heart overflowed with love for her friends. She wished for the selfish wishes to no longer exist.

As the coin dropped into the well, a golden light enveloped the village. A gentle breeze swept through Evergreena, carrying away the echoes of the negative wishes and ushering in an air of peacefulness. When the light cleared, Evergreena was restored. The children, once obsessed with acquiring, now played together happily. Toys they did possess were shared and enjoyed. The mountains of sweets had disappeared. The well retained its capacity for generosity but the children no longer sought out those treats or riches. The adults returned. Their faces no longer displayed a sense of sadness, instead they showed contentment. And the families all grew a little closer once more.

Life returned to the rhythm of Evergreena as before, but it wasn't quite the same. The children still visited the wishing well, but they didn't wish for material things. They wished for simple things, things that filled the heart: for the rain to water the fields, for sunshine for the gardens, for strength for a sick friend. And as the years passed, they realized that these wishes, born out of genuine love and concern, were the most precious of all. The best wishes of all were to build up each other, not tear one another down. The best wish was for an end to this constant grasping for rewards. The secret of the well, they understood, was not about having your every desire fulfilled; it was about having the needs of those around them be taken care of.

The moss-covered well in the whispering woods remained, a reminder of both joy and temptation. The children of Evergreena understood that the magic wasn't just in the granting of wishes. The magic was in their own hearts. It was in their capacity for love, kindness, and sharing. It was a tale passed down from generation to generation, a lesson learned in a time when wishes came true, everyday, to remember the true treasures of life.
