<title>Sammy the Squirrel's Surprise</title>
<body>
Sammy the Squirrel was, to put it mildly, a worrier. Not a fluffy-tailed, acorn-hoarding worrier, no. Sammy was a full-blown, twitchy-nosed, “Is the sky falling?” kind of worrier. He worried about everything: the wind being too windy, the sun being too sunny, and whether or not his favourite oak tree would suddenly decide to sprout legs and go for a wander.

His best friend, Barnaby Bear, was the exact opposite. Barnaby was a happy-go-lucky sort, the kind of bear who'd happily nap through a thunderstorm while juggling pine cones. He considered Sammy’s worries rather amusing, though he loved Sammy dearly.

One Tuesday, Sammy was perched precariously on a particularly shaky twig, scrutinizing a rather ordinary looking cloud. “Do you think it’s going to rain meatballs, Barnaby?” he squeaked, his nose twitching with concern.

Barnaby, who was currently attempting (and failing spectacularly) to tie a knot in a dandelion stem, yawned widely. “Meatballs, Sammy? Where would the meatballs *come* from?”

“Well, that’s what I’m worried about!” Sammy insisted. “I mean, what if they're giant meatballs? What if they squash us? What if they're *spicy* meatballs?”

Barnaby chuckled, the dandelion stem finally snapping in frustration. “Oh, Sammy. You worry too much. Come on, let's go collect some berries. Worrying makes you peckish, doesn't it?"

Sammy, though still convinced of the impending meaty downpour, conceded. The thought of juicy, red berries was, undeniably, rather appealing.

As they ambled through the forest, their stomachs rumbling, Sammy continued to fret. "Are those berry bushes healthy enough? Are they growing in the right kind of soil? Do you think any sneaky foxes are planning to hide behind them and…"

Barnaby interrupted, putting a paw gently on Sammy's shoulder. “Sammy, breathe. Berries. Remember? Delicious, lovely berries."

They arrived at their favourite berry patch, a haven of plump, juicy raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. But just as they were about to begin their feasting, a sign caught Sammy’s eye. It was a hand-painted sign, wobbling slightly, that read: “THE GREAT FOREST FUN FAIR – TODAY ONLY!”

Sammy gasped. “A fair! Oh dear! Are there…danger signs? Are there…dodgy rides? Is the candy floss secretly made of…spiders?”

Barnaby, who'd already popped a handful of blueberries into his mouth, simply shook his head and munched. “Relax, Sammy. It’ll be fine. Let's go check it out.”

And so, reluctantly, Sammy followed Barnaby towards the sounds of laughter and music.

The fair was a dazzling spectacle! There were games, stalls, and rides galore. Barnaby was immediately captivated. He joined a game of “Pin the Tail on the Badger,” wobbling all over the place but somehow managing to win a giant, fluffy teddy bear (which he immediately named “Berry”).

Sammy, however, was a bundle of nerves. He clung to Barnaby's side, his eyes darting around, taking in every possible hazard. He worried about the strength of the tent poles, the stability of the wobbly-wheel-of-fortune, and the potential for pigeons to attack the hotdog vendors.

“Look, Sammy,” Barnaby boomed, holding out the teddy bear. “Berry is coming with us! Isn’t he magnificent?”

Sammy stared at the bear. It *was* magnificent, with a comically large bow tie and a single, button eye that seemed to be staring directly at him. He shuddered. "I…I think I might prefer the safety of this bush," he mumbled.

Barnaby just laughed and suggested they try the "Spinning Teacups of Ticklishness."

The teacups, Sammy discovered, were indeed ticklish. Each spin of the teacup made him giggle uncontrollably, but he was also constantly scanning the horizon for any rogue teacups attempting an escape. He clung on for dear life until the ride thankfully stopped.

Next they approached the "Acorn Toss." It involved throwing acorns into a clown's enormous, gaping mouth. "Acorns are round," Sammy declared, “They roll. They might...they might roll right *out* of the clown's mouth and towards us!"

Barnaby, however, saw this as an excellent opportunity to test his aim. He expertly tossed several acorns directly into the clown’s mouth, earning a loud clap of appreciation. Sammy, in a desperate attempt to find some semblance of control, spent the duration of the game calculating the trajectory of each acorn and its probability of squashing him. He emerged, unharmed, yet feeling quite worn out.

Then, disaster struck. Or, rather, a minor inconvenience occurred that Sammy, being Sammy, interpreted as a complete disaster.

A particularly enthusiastic puff of wind – not even a very strong one – knocked over a stall selling…drum roll…gummy worms!

Gummy worms, which are already fairly wiggly, cascaded across the ground in a sticky, multicoloured heap.

Sammy screamed, leaping into the air. "It's the gummy worm apocalypse!" he wailed. "They’re everywhere! They’re coming to get us! They’re...they’re made of SUGAR!"

Barnaby, however, was not worried. He simply scooped up a handful of gummy worms and began to eat them with gusto. "Mmm, delicious," he declared through a mouthful of sugar-coated delight. “Want some, Sammy?"

Sammy, mesmerized by the rainbow river of gummy worms, took a tentative step forward. Then, another. The horror was…delicious? He nibbled cautiously on a red gummy worm. Then, a green one. Then, he forgot all about worrying. He and Barnaby spent the next hour giggling and squishing through the sugary puddle.

Finally, as the sun began to set, they were covered head to toe in sticky sweetness. They collapsed in a pile of exhausted joy near the entrance to the fair.

“Well, Sammy,” Barnaby said, wiping a smear of gummy worm from his paw. “That was fun, wasn’t it?”

Sammy, still slightly sugar-buzzed, nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! It was… it was… unexpected. The gummy worm apocalypse turned out to be… delicious.”

Barnaby chuckled. “You know, Sammy, sometimes things aren’t as bad as they seem.”

Sammy thought about the meatballs, the wobbly rides, the potential pigeon attacks, and the unexpected joy of the gummy worms. He had been wrong about almost everything. He sighed contentedly. “You’re right, Barnaby. You're absolutely right.”

Suddenly, Sammy noticed a strange aroma. A delicious, sweet, sugary aroma, similar to… candy floss? He perked up. "Barnaby," he squeaked, "do you think…"

Barnaby grinned. "Do you think there's a candy floss stall that we missed? Now, *that* would be a real surprise, wouldn't it?"

As they made their way towards the enticing aroma of spun sugar, holding hands in friendship and anticipation of another unforeseen, but delicious, adventure, Sammy felt a very strange and unusual feeling – not worry, but excitement.
And as they spotted the sign, and with a look of joyful curiosity, he asked his friend Barnaby, "Can we ask for some extra strawberry?"

Barnaby Bear simply nodded and they skipped towards the Candy floss stand.

The End.
