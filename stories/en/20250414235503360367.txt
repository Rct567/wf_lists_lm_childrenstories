<title>Finding a Friendly Ghost Who Didn't Want To Scare Anyone.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and shimmering, clear-blue rivers, stood a grand, old house. The house was called Whispering Pines Manor. It had been there for centuries, and it held many secrets within its thick stone walls. People in the nearby village said Whispering Pines Manor was haunted. They spoke in hushed tones, warning children to stay away, whispering of a spooky ghost who loved to frighten anyone who dared to enter.

But, the truth was a little different.

Inside Whispering Pines Manor lived a ghost. His name was Bartholomew, and he wasn't scary at all. In fact, Bartholomew was a very kind and gentle ghost. He preferred playing hide-and-seek amongst the cobwebs and dust bunnies to jumping out and shouting "Boo!" He loved to hum little tunes and watch the sunlight dance through the dusty windows. Bartholomew just wanted a friend.

Bartholomew had been a ghost for a very, very long time. He remembered when the manor was new, filled with laughter and music. He recalled grand balls and bustling family Christmases. He missed the warmth of the living, the joy of friendship, and the simple pleasure of sharing a story. Unfortunately, everyone was frightened of ghosts. He had tried making friends before, but each time, they had run screaming. Bartholomew would sigh, his translucent form shimmering with sadness. He didn't understand why everyone thought he was so scary.

One day, a little girl named Lily skipped down the lane leading up to Whispering Pines Manor. Lily was known for her bravery, her bright, curious eyes, and her bright red wellington boots. Unlike the other villagers, Lily wasn't afraid of the manor. She'd always been fascinated by its towering structure and the mystery it held.

Lily clutched a bright yellow notebook and a box of crayons, her tiny fingers wrapped firmly around them. She loved to draw, and she often imagined the grand manor house filled with fantastic creatures and hidden wonders. She’d heard the stories, of course, but her heart told her there was more to the house than whispered warnings of a terrifying ghost.

Lily approached the heavy oak door, its surface darkened with age and speckled with spiderwebs. She hesitated for only a moment, then, taking a deep breath, she pushed the door open. The door creaked in protest, the sound echoing through the vast, silent entrance hall.

"Hello?" Lily called out, her voice a small, chirping sound in the enormous space.

The air was still and heavy with the scent of dust and old wood. Sunlight streamed through the tall, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the beams of light. Lily began to walk forward cautiously, her wellington boots making small, rhythmic taps on the stone floor. She ventured further, into a large room that appeared to have once been a ballroom.

Suddenly, a shimmering shape floated into view. Lily gasped, her eyes widening in surprise. A gentle face with soft eyes, wispy hair, and a kind smile, which sat atop a translucent body that was slightly blurred, floated in front of her.

It was a ghost.

But he wasn't scary.

"Hello," the ghost said, his voice a soft whisper. "Welcome to Whispering Pines Manor."

Lily, instead of screaming as everyone expected, just blinked and grinned. "Hello! I'm Lily," she said. "Are you the ghost everyone talks about?"

Bartholomew nodded, his translucent form seeming to wobble slightly with shyness. “Yes, I am. Bartholomew is my name."

Lily's grin widened. "I'm not scared of you," she declared. "You look friendly!"

Bartholomew’s ghostly form brightened. "You're not?" He looked so surprised and happy that his wispy hair nearly stood up on end. "No one has ever said that before."

“Everyone thinks you’re scary,” Lily explained, sitting cross-legged on the dusty floor. "But you don't look scary at all. You look…nice."

Bartholomew sighed again, his translucent form shifting gently. "I try not to be. I don't like scaring people. I just… I’m a bit lonely."

Lily tilted her head. "Lonely? I can help with that! I love making friends!"

And so, an unlikely friendship began.

Lily visited Whispering Pines Manor every day. She and Bartholomew explored the house together. Lily sketched pictures of Bartholomew and the manor in her bright yellow notebook. She discovered hidden rooms, secret passages, and dusty treasures. Bartholomew showed her the best places to find hidden trinkets, described the past owners of the house, and shared stories from his long existence as a ghost. He learned she loved bright colours, delicious smells and that if he felt excited he started shimmering a more bright shade of silver.

Bartholomew loved to hear Lily's laughter echoing through the empty halls. He especially enjoyed helping Lily with her drawings. He would point out the subtle variations in light and shadow, help her to find the perfect angles, and even pose in different positions to help her capture his ghostly form on paper.

Lily taught Bartholomew about the world outside the manor. She described the changing seasons, the joys of picnics in the sun, and the wonder of building sandcastles at the beach. She taught him games such as hide-and-seek, her cheerful giggles filling the manor as Bartholomew struggled to hide in the open, always leaving parts of him visible to Lily. She described a myriad of delights. He loved the colour red, because it was the colour of Lily's wellington boots, and he loved the taste of the cookies she would bake at her house, taking care that she brought enough for him.

Word of Lily's daily visits to Whispering Pines Manor soon reached the village. The townsfolk, initially hesitant, became curious. They saw Lily skipping happily, never afraid, and they heard stories about a kind, helpful ghost.

One sunny afternoon, a group of villagers, led by a brave young boy named Thomas, decided to cautiously approach the manor. They knocked gently on the heavy oak door. Lily, who had been reading aloud to Bartholomew in the library, went to open it, her face glowing with excitement.

"Hello!" she greeted them with a warm smile. "Come in, come in!"

The villagers hesitantly stepped inside, their eyes wide with apprehension. They whispered, worried, and some of them were ready to turn and run.

Bartholomew, startled by the sudden arrival of so many people, hovered nervously near the ceiling, his translucent form flickering a little. Lily noticed his unease and immediately offered reassurances, “It’s alright, Bartholomew. They want to meet you.”

Lily then turned to the villagers. "Don't worry," she said with a reassuring smile. "Bartholomew is not scary. He's really very friendly." She pointed to Bartholomew. "Come on, don't be shy!"

Bartholomew slowly descended, his ghostly form shimmering gently as he floated towards the visitors. He offered a tentative smile, then began to wave politely. The villagers stared, stunned by how kind Bartholomew seemed.

After a moment, Thomas, the young boy who had led the group, stepped forward. "Um… hello, Mr. Bartholomew," he said, his voice trembling a little.

Bartholomew beamed. "Please, call me Bartholomew. And please, there is no need to be afraid."

Over the next few weeks, the villagers began to visit Whispering Pines Manor more frequently. They helped Lily and Bartholomew clean and tidy the house. They shared meals together. They listened to Bartholomew’s stories. They played games. They learned that the "haunted house" was actually a home, filled with warmth, friendship, and laughter. The entire town grew to love Bartholomew as a friend.

Bartholomew, no longer lonely, blossomed. He learned to tell jokes (which were often quite silly, but everyone loved them nonetheless) and he was very good at hide-and-seek. He found happiness, as he had the companionship he always dreamed of. The manor, once shrouded in an atmosphere of fear and mystery, became a place of joy and friendship, all because of a friendly ghost, a brave little girl with bright red wellington boots, and the power of kindness.

And so, the tale of Bartholomew, the friendly ghost who didn't want to scare anyone, became a cherished legend in the village, a reminder that sometimes, what seems scary on the outside can be filled with the most wonderful of treasures on the inside. The villagers would often remark how the dust seemed to gleam with kindness inside Whispering Pines Manor.
The manor became a place of parties and of friendship, with many lovely smiles filling its rooms. The children would beg their parents to tell them more tales of their favourite ghost. It was a joy.

The End.
