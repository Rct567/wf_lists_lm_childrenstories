<title>The Rainbow's Rescue of the River Rats</title>
<body>
Barnaby Buckleberry, a river rat with whiskers like tangled yarn and eyes like polished pebbles, loved his life.  He loved the gurgling, the squelching, the smells of damp earth and blooming water lilies.  He loved his river, the Rippleton, more than anything in the world.  Especially its hidden nooks, where he could stash his treasures – shiny pebbles, oddly-shaped leaves, and, his most prized possession, a tiny, chipped teacup.  

But this summer, the Rippleton was in trouble.  A terrible drought had descended, turning the once-bubbly river into a shallow, muddy trickle.  The water lilies drooped, the fish swam in circles, and the river rats were in a flap.  

Barnaby and his fellow rats, Pip Squeak, a perpetually worried rat with a tail that twitched constantly, and Hazel Nut, whose nose was always buried in something delicious, held desperate meetings under a wilting water lily pad. "We're doomed!" cried Pip Squeak, his whiskers trembling.

"But where will we find more water?" asked Hazel, her tummy rumbling.

Barnaby, however, had a spark of an idea.  He remembered the shimmering, magical rainbows he'd seen in the distant sky during the summer rain. Perhaps...

"Maybe the rainbows can help us," he whispered, remembering stories told by the ancient river turtles about rainbows carrying hidden pockets of rain.

The other rats scoffed.  "Rainbows?  Ridiculous!" snorted Pip Squeak.

"We've seen rain before but there was no magic to it," Hazel added.

Undeterred, Barnaby climbed the highest, muddiest bank, peering at the clear, cloudless sky. There, spanning the whole horizon, was a magnificent rainbow, its colours brighter than a thousand sunsets. "Perhaps if we ask it," Barnaby whispered, "it will help."

With a deep breath and a squeak, Barnaby started to shout, “Rainbow, Rainbow, you are magnificent! We are the river rats of Rippleton, and our river is dying! Please, help us!”

He was surprised when the rainbow seemed to ripple, to hum, and to glow with more intensity. A flash of lightning, brighter than any he’d ever seen, seemed to strike the end of the rainbow. And then, a golden bucket, filled with shimmering rain, fell from the clouds. The water, cool and fresh, landed in the Rippleton, making it sing its old song, flowing and tumbling again. The water lilies bloomed and the fish swam happily in the refreshed waters.

“It worked!” Barnaby cheered, overjoyed. Pip Squeak, his whiskers no longer trembling, squealed with delight.  Hazel, finally satiated from the revitalized stream, tucked into some delectable lily pad treats.

From that day on, Barnaby and his fellow river rats always offered thanks to the rainbows, remembering their grand rescue and how powerful an act of kindness – or in this case, a request – could be.

News of the rainbow's generosity spread like wildfire.  The nearby village children, curious about the sudden downpour, learned about Barnaby and the other rats, and the wonderful, humble miracle of the Rippleton's recovery.

One particularly bright and curious girl, Lily Blossom, decided to visit the river every day.  She learned about the river rats' daily routines and the history of the Rippleton.  She even started collecting river pebbles, leaving them in exchange for little drawings of the sparkling water lilies.

Pip Squeak, once perpetually anxious, now had less reason to fret, since they had a beautiful river teeming with happy creatures.  And Hazel, with a never-ending appreciation for the bounty of Rippleton, shared the best-picked water lily blossoms with Lily Blossom and all the nearby creatures.

Barnaby, of course, still loved his teacup, but now he carried it with extra care, not just as a treasure, but as a reminder of the day the rainbow saved their precious home.  The Rippleton flowed strong, the air was fresh, and life was joyous all along the riverbank.  Every time the rainbow arched in the sky, the river rats paused to give a little squeak of gratitude, knowing that their extraordinary friendship with the rainbow would last forever.  The beautiful colours, the warm water, and the sounds all meant one thing. It was a perfect summer indeed, because everyone needed to live by a river that could roar again.
