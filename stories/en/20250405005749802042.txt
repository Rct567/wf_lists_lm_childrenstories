<title>Una Understands Uplifting Unicorns</title>
<body>
"Can we go to the Whispering Woods today, Mama?" chirped Una, her bright blue eyes sparkling with excitement. She bounced on the balls of her feet, her two pigtails swinging back and forth like happy pendulums.

Mama, a kind woman with a warm smile and hair the color of sunset, chuckled. "Well, Una, the Whispering Woods is quite far. And it's a rather magical place, isn’t it?"

"Yes, Mama! Magical!" Una squealed. "Especially the part about the… the… unicorns!"

Mama winked. "Especially the unicorns. What makes them so special, Una?"

Una paused, thoughtfully. She tapped a finger against her chin, mimicking a pose she’d seen in her favourite storybook. "Well," she began, "they’re sparkly, and they have horns, and they make wishes come true… I think."

"And they spread kindness and joy wherever they go," Mama added gently.

"Yes! And they uplift things!" Una exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder.

"Uplift things?" Mama raised an eyebrow, a playful smile dancing on her lips. "What does 'uplift' mean, my sweet Una?"

Una thought for a moment. "It means… to make things better! To make them… lighter!" She gestured with her hands as if trying to lift an invisible object.

"That's a very good description," Mama said approvingly. "Unicorns certainly do that, don't they? They lift spirits and make everyone feel happy."

"Can we find one today, Mama? Can we, can we, can we?" Una pleaded, clasping her hands together.

Mama hesitated, glancing at the afternoon sun. "It's getting late, and the woods can be tricky to navigate, Una. Perhaps we should plan a special trip. How about tomorrow, first thing in the morning? We can pack a picnic and make a proper adventure of it!"

Una's shoulders slumped momentarily, then her face brightened. "Tomorrow! That's perfect! Oh, I'm so excited!" She dashed around the kitchen, her excitement palpable. "I'll get my best unicorn-shaped backpack ready!"

The next morning, the sun streamed through the window as Una, fuelled by anticipation, woke up before dawn. She practically flew out of bed, already dressed in her favourite rainbow-striped leggings and a t-shirt with a glittery unicorn on it.

“Are you ready for our adventure, my little explorer?” Mama asked, handing her a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the shape of a star.

“More than ready!” Una chirped, grabbing her backpack.

As they walked into the Whispering Woods, the air seemed to shimmer with a gentle magic. Sunlight dappled through the leaves, creating dancing patterns on the forest floor. Birdsong filled the air, a sweet melody that followed them as they ventured deeper.

"Remember to be observant, Una," Mama instructed. "Look for signs of unicorns. They often leave little… clues."

"Clues!" Una exclaimed, her eyes scanning every inch of their surroundings. She kept her senses at alert as if she was expecting someone or something that could suddenly spring up.

After walking for what felt like a long time to Una, they arrived at a clearing. In the centre, there stood a babbling brook, sparkling under the morning light. Butterflies, adorned with wings as colorful as Una's leggings, fluttered around the stream.

"Wow!" Una breathed, her eyes wide. "It’s so beautiful here, Mama!"

"It is, isn't it? This is where I've heard the unicorns are most often sighted. Perhaps we can have our picnic here," Mama suggested, unpacking their baskets.

Una spent the next hour searching for any sign of the mythical creatures. She meticulously inspected every flower, peeked behind every tree, and carefully examined every rock.

"Did you find anything, sweetie?" Mama asked as she opened up the food items they’d prepared.

Una shook her head. "Not a thing! I wish they'd leave some sparkles or a feather. Even a footprint would do!" Her voice betrayed a tinge of disappointment.

Suddenly, she spotted something lying near the brook. "Mama! Look!" she cried, pointing to a small, crumpled piece of paper.

Mama approached and picked it up. "It looks like someone’s been careless, leaving their trash on the ground, which is not very uplifting, Una, is it?" she said.

Una wrinkled her nose. "No, not at all." She realized this wasn't a good start to uplifting things.

They carefully unfolded the paper. It was a small drawing of a wilting flower, with a sad little sun in the corner. Beneath the drawing, a handwritten note read: “I’m feeling sad.”

Una's heart softened at the words on the page. She was immediately upset for whomever this paper was from. She had her own experience of feelings and emotions.

"Poor little flower," Una murmured. "It's sad. We must help it!"

"What can we do?" Mama asked, stroking her chin thoughtfully.

Una's eyes brightened. "We can uplift it! We can make it feel happy!"

"And how do you propose we do that, my clever girl?" Mama asked with a smile.

Una thought for a moment. She remembered a time when she was feeling down herself. "We can cheer it up with laughter!" she said with resolve. "And maybe… and maybe we can draw the sun a smile!"

And so they did. They carefully sketched a beaming smile on the sun, and even added a few cheerful butterflies fluttering around the wilting flower. They even decided to leave their food out for any hungry creatures, be it the flower, the sun, or the butterflies.

"Now, isn't that much better?" Mama asked, smiling.

Una beamed. "Yes, Mama! It's much more uplifting!"

As they finished their small act of kindness, they heard a faint whinny. Una froze, her eyes widening. They were no longer focused on the drawing, but to where the sound had come from. They were determined and filled with anticipation.

They peered through the trees, and there, standing at the edge of the clearing, was a unicorn! It had a shimmering white coat, a long, flowing mane the colors of the rainbow, and a spiraling horn that gleamed in the sunlight.

Una gasped. "It's a… a unicorn!"

The unicorn lowered its head and looked at their hand-painted picture. It dipped its head once in acknowledgement.

Una, forgetting her initial excitement, ran to pick it up. She brought the painted flower and the happy sun closer to the unicorn.

The unicorn nudged the drawing with its horn, as if approving their efforts.

Then, to their amazement, the wilting flower in the picture began to bloom, its petals opening wider, and the sad sun suddenly seemed to shine brighter. The colors started to glow even brighter. The butterflies even started to fly away with happiness.

Una was astonished. "Wow! The drawing... it is just like the unicorns did a miracle!" she proclaimed.

The unicorn then turned to look at them. It slowly extended a leg to touch the drawing.

"You're so magical!" Una whispered. "Thank you for… uplifting our drawing!"

The unicorn smiled, its expression as soft as the breeze. It lowered its head, as if bowing. A single, shimmering tear rolled down its cheek and landed on the paper.

Then, the unicorn turned and galloped gracefully into the woods. It didn’t stop until it was no longer visible to the eyes.

Una and Mama looked at each other in amazement.

"It’s like the unicorn helped us to understand," Una whispered, looking again at the transformed picture. "The unicorns didn’t just uplift with magic, Mama. They uplift by inspiring kindness."

Mama smiled. "You’ve understood it perfectly, Una," she said, placing her hand on her daughter's shoulder. "Unicorns are all about making the world a brighter place, one kind act at a time. They can't do everything for themselves. They need all our assistance to spread such positivity."

"And we can be unicorns too, Mama!" Una declared, her eyes shining. "We can uplift everyone!"

"Indeed, my dear," Mama said. "Every day. That is the magic of unicorns."

And from that day forward, Una understood that being uplifting meant much more than just magic. It meant kindness, helping others, and spreading happiness wherever she went. She began to look for ways to uplift the world, small acts of kindness that she shared with anyone and everyone. She realised the true value of unicorns. The Whispering Woods never ceased to call out her name. And she often left little drawings with messages of positivity, hoping, someday, to encounter the beautiful, kind, and uplifting unicorns again.
