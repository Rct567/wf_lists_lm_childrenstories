<title>The Princess Who Didn't Want to Be Rescued and Slept Late.</title>
<body>
Princess Poppy wasn't like other princesses.  She didn't swoon at the sight of a knight in shining armour, and she definitely didn't pine for a prince to whisk her away.  Poppy preferred fluffy pillows, warm mugs of cocoa, and the delightful rustle of pages in a good book.  Her castle, nestled high atop a mountain of giant, sugary marshmallows (a rather unusual location, we'll get to that later), was her happy place.

The problem?  Poppy had a severe case of chronic lateness, and the marshmallow mountain was particularly treacherous when one was running late.  And running late for her own rescue was practically an Olympic sport in the royal family.

It all started with the dreadful Dragon of Drowsiness.  This wasn't a fearsome fire-breathing beast.  Oh no, this dragon exhaled dreamy clouds of sleep that were irresistible to all the inhabitants of the marshmallow mountain, including, unfortunately, Princess Poppy.

Every morning, the royal herald would announce the approaching Dragon's fiery (or rather, sleep-inducing) breath.  "The Dragon of Drowsiness is descending!" the herald's voice echoed through the fluffy fortress.  Every single princess in the kingdom, without exception, knew the drill: get ready to be rescued.  Except Poppy.

Poppy, bless her heart, would often be caught deep within the most captivating chapters of her latest adventure novel, completely oblivious to the rising tide of drowsiness washing over the castle.

One particularly sunny morning, the royal herald’s booming voice pierced through Poppy's dreamy world.  "The Dragon of Drowsiness is descending!" he bellowed.

"Oh, great," Poppy mumbled, pulling the covers over her head.  "Not now."

The castle, typically a whirlwind of frantic activity, was oddly silent.  The other princesses, all in pristine, meticulously-arranged, rescue-ready outfits, were already preparing their dramatic rescues (rescuing from being lulled to sleep by the dragon was pretty dramatic).  Princess Rose, known for her shimmering emerald gowns and sparkling cape, already had her helmet strapped on.  Princess Lily, ever graceful, was meticulously arranging her flower crown to maximise the amount of flower pollen flying when she arrived at the rescue.  All except Princess Poppy, still snuggled within her bed, oblivious to the approaching peril.

The Dragon of Drowsiness arrived, a fluffy, sleepy-eyed beast, its nostrils puffing out billowing clouds of cotton candy-scented sleep.  Poppy felt a gentle tug, a sigh of the sleepy clouds. She yawned and, to everyone's horror, sunk deeper into her marshmallow-filled bed.

This was no ordinary predicament.  This was a kingdom-wide slumber-fest.  The entire population of the sugary castle - the royal guard, the royal chefs, even the royal hamsters – were fast asleep.

The heroes, the princesses who were supposed to swoop into action, were, of course, fast asleep too.  All of them.  Everyone.

Suddenly, a tiny, bright voice squeaked from beneath a mountain of pillows.  It was Pip, the royal pet hummingbird. "He needs... help... to wake..." he whispered, vibrating with exertion, to the nearest princess who could hear his frantic buzz.


A moment of absolute silence fell upon the slumbering kingdom.  Then, a sound, faint at first, but quickly growing stronger. It was Pip, the tiny hummingbird.  He had found a solution to wake everyone. He used a very long feather, reaching up into the skies to retrieve a magical sunrise whistle from a nearby mountaintop that only he, the little hummingbird, could reach!

Pip whistled. A single, high-pitched, piercing note pierced through the sweet, sleepy air.  

And slowly, gradually, the world around him began to stir.   First the chefs’ heads popped up, blinking slowly. The hamster started spinning wildly on a wheel in protest of such an interruption of its sleep. One by one, with great groaning and stretching, every sleepy inhabitant awoke.   It was the most extraordinary morning the sugary castle had ever experienced!  

Princess Poppy woke up with a gasp.  “Oh, dear!” she exclaimed, instantly springing out of bed and trying to frantically get dressed, having finally realised the magnitude of her crime.   She saw all the bewildered faces and jumped to help. “Don’t worry,” she whispered to the worried looking princesses, ” I got this.”

Poppy, with a heroic dash and much laughter and many flourishes, quickly realised Pip's great accomplishment. The whole ordeal had been quite ridiculous.  Poppy used her innate creativity and rallied the sleepy citizens around a quick scheme that had everybody back in action, prepared for any challenges in the morning and a delightful celebration soon followed!

And from that day forward, the kingdom, still filled with marshmallows, made an extraordinary promise to Poppy. They no longer expected her to be the swift rescue; they understood and appreciated that she was the funniest and most wonderful member of the whole royal family.  And Poppy, finally in time and still armed with her favourite book and her ever-optimistic heart, had a truly extraordinary morning in the kingdom of delicious sleep and equally delicious camaraderie.
