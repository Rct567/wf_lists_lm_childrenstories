<title>Paddington's Picnic with the Polite Pandas</title>
<body>
Paddington Bear hummed a cheerful tune, his little red hat perched jauntily on his head. He was quite excited. Today was the day of the annual Paddington Gardens Picnic, and this year, he’d promised to organise it. The theme? "Polite Animals Around the World". Paddington had spent the last few weeks writing invitations and preparing his special marmalade sandwiches.

He carefully arranged a picnic basket, a checkered cloth spread neatly over his arm. Inside the basket, besides the sandwiches, were pots of raspberry jam (Paddington's favourite, even more so than marmalade), a thermos of hot chocolate, and a book of animal etiquette he’d borrowed from Mrs. Bird.

As he walked through Paddington Station, on his way to the gardens, he bumped into Mr. Gruber.

"Good morning, Mr. Gruber!" Paddington said, beaming. "I'm off to the picnic! Would you like to join me?"

Mr. Gruber, his kind face lighting up, replied, "Why, Paddington, that's a splendid idea! I would be delighted. I’ve even made some delicious pastries.” He held up a small bag overflowing with freshly baked goods.

Paddington’s tummy rumbled in anticipation. "Oh, wonderful! Thank you, Mr. Gruber. We'll have a lovely time."

Together, they headed to the park. The sun was shining, and the air smelled of freshly cut grass. As they arrived at Paddington Gardens, the scene before them was a delightful riot of colour and activity. Decorations were everywhere: banners that read "Welcome, Polite Animals!", balloons shaped like various creatures, and tables laden with goodies.

Paddington spotted a group of bears near the central fountain. They looked quite unlike the bears Paddington knew; these were the Polite Pandas he'd invited. He waved enthusiastically, and rushed over.

"Good morning, Pandas!" Paddington greeted them, puffing slightly from his short sprint. "Welcome to the picnic! I'm Paddington."

The largest Panda, who had a neatly folded napkin tucked into his collar, bowed elegantly. “Greetings, Paddington. It is a pleasure to be here. I am Elder Pan, and these are my companions.” He gestured to the other pandas, each with a meticulously groomed coat and a serene expression.

Paddington couldn’t help but grin. “It’s so wonderful to have you! I’ve brought my best marmalade sandwiches, especially for the occasion. And Mr. Gruber here has some delicious pastries." He gestured towards Mr. Gruber who had now arrived and was already carefully placing the pastries on a nearby table.

Elder Pan bowed again. "We are most grateful. We appreciate your kindness, Paddington. Our family always prioritizes manners. Before we begin our feast, may we offer you and your companion, Mr. Gruber, a lesson in proper picnic etiquette?"

Paddington's eyes widened. "A lesson? Oh, yes please! I'm always eager to learn new things."

And so began Paddington’s impromptu etiquette lesson. Elder Pan and his fellow Pandas explained the importance of sharing, respecting personal space, and cleaning up after oneself. They demonstrated how to hold a teacup properly, how to fold a napkin beautifully, and how to bow in respect before sampling the food.

Paddington listened attentively, occasionally scribbling notes in a small notepad he'd brought along. He was fascinated by the Pandas’ graceful movements and their calm, deliberate manner. He discovered that, according to the Pandas, chewing with your mouth closed was very important. Paddington sometimes struggled with this, especially when he ate his favourite marmalade sandwiches, which tended to have quite a bit of marmalade that ran down his paws. He made a mental note to eat more slowly this time and to take extra care to clean up every little marmalade drop.

"Remember, Paddington," said Panda Peony, a younger, particularly friendly panda, "sharing is caring, and cleanliness is next to...well, you know, a very good thing indeed!"

Mr. Gruber, meanwhile, enjoyed the lesson. He nodded approvingly and even offered to help the Pandas fold their napkins into the shape of swans, which they all thought were particularly charming.

Paddington followed every piece of advice, with Mr. Gruber at his side, smiling encouragingly. He tried his best to eat his sandwich with dignity and to avoid getting marmalade on his whiskers. He managed to resist the temptation to lick the jam pot after dipping his finger.

As the picnic continued, other polite animals arrived: A troupe of elegant French Poodles, who bowed beautifully as they introduced themselves; a group of industrious Beavers who offered to build a more comfortable seating area out of soft willow branches; a wise old Owl from Australia, who shared his advice on proper communication.

The French Poodles explained the correct way to arrange a table, insisting on perfectly symmetrical placements of forks and knives. Paddington learned that one should never put the salt and pepper shakers on the wrong side of the table.

The beavers, after setting up their seating, began offering constructive criticism of Paddington’s chosen picnic spot; they politely, but firmly, declared that it was a little too exposed and vulnerable to sudden breezes. Paddington thanked them kindly and considered the issue.

The Australian owl, Professor Howler, contributed wise proverbs: "Speak gently and listen with an open mind," he advised. He emphasized that asking for help with grace was often preferable to suffering in silence.

Paddington thoroughly enjoyed the entire affair and took every opportunity to practise his new lessons. When some rogue crumbs fell from his sandwich, he meticulously brushed them away, using a corner of his napkin. He carefully wiped his paws with the wet towel, borrowed from the Poodles.

At one point, a slight breeze rustled the tablecloth. A particularly mischievous squirrel, attracted by the promise of scattered food, darted towards the picnic table. In his excitement, the squirrel nudged a bowl of strawberries. The strawberries spilled over, creating a sticky mess on the grass.

Paddington was about to rush forward, eager to clean up the mess. He remembered Elder Pan's lesson, “Maintain composure even when things don't go as planned.” He took a deep breath and took out his napkin and began carefully picking up the strawberries, his small brow furrowed in concentration. Mr. Gruber came over to help, and, together, they quickly cleared up the mess. The French poodles delicately and immediately offered assistance with the tablecloth.

As the day drew to a close, Paddington found that the whole experience was much more fun and enjoyable because of the politeness displayed by all the animals. He'd learned that kindness and good manners really could enhance a picnic.

Paddington gathered everyone near to the central fountain, and gave a short speech.

"Thank you, everyone," he said, his voice slightly muffled by the crumbs that were still clinging to his marmalade-stained mouth. He patted his tummy in contentment. “Thank you, especially to the Polite Pandas, for your valuable lessons, and thank you all for coming and making this the best picnic ever."

All the animals clapped in agreement. The Pandas, in perfect synchronisation, bowed, the Poodles took to a gracious curtsey, the Beaves did a collective nod and even the professor made a single respectful hoot.

As the sun began to set, Paddington, along with Mr. Gruber, and the other animals, began to pack up. Even Paddington found that he enjoyed cleaning up this year, a side effect of his newly acquired sense of propriety. He helped fold the checkered tablecloth, his small paws now remarkably marmalade-free.

Paddington knew he would treasure this picnic forever. Not just for the delicious marmalade sandwiches and raspberry jam, but because he had learned so much about being polite. He made a mental note to visit the Polite Pandas more often to keep practicing his lessons and vowed to share these new skills with everyone he met.

As they walked home, Mr. Gruber put his arm around Paddington.

“Well done, Paddington,” Mr. Gruber said with a warm smile. "You organised a wonderful picnic."

Paddington smiled back, his eyes twinkling. “And, Mr. Gruber, I have learned something very important today. Being polite really does make everything much more... enjoyable!” He then added “And you know, I haven't had a single marmalade-y accident!”
