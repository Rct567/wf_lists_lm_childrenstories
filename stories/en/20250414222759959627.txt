<title>Grace's Garden of Greens</title>
<body>
“Look, Grandma!” Grace squealed, pointing a muddy finger at a tiny green sprout pushing its way out of the soil. "It's happening!"

Grandma Willow, her face crinkled into a smile like a well-loved map, chuckled. She leaned down, her knees creaking a little. “Indeed it is, little one. That’s a little lettuce seedling, bursting to life.”

They were in Grandma Willow's garden, a riot of colour and smells, buzzing with bees and the cheerful chirping of birds. It was Grace's favourite place in the whole world. Row upon row, all kinds of plants flourished. Tomatoes, plump and red, hung heavy on their vines, vibrant sunflowers reached for the sky, and the air hummed with the scent of herbs – rosemary, thyme, and basil.

"But why lettuce, Grandma?" Grace asked, her brow furrowing slightly. She preferred strawberries and the bright orange carrots.

"Because, my dear, lettuce is important," Grandma Willow replied, carefully straightening up. "It's part of a balanced meal. And it's yummy!"

“But strawberries are yummy-er!” Grace insisted, crossing her arms.

Grandma Willow smiled. "We’ll have plenty of strawberries, my sweet. But today, we're focusing on the greens. Do you know why we call them greens, Grace?"

Grace shook her head, her pigtails bouncing.

“Because most of them are green, like that little sprout! They’re healthy and strong and help us grow.” Grandma Willow beckoned her closer, then pointed to a nearby bed, overflowing with a variety of leafy greens. “Look at this, Grace. This is a rainbow of greens.”

Grace gasped. "Wow!"

"See? This is spinach," Grandma Willow said, pointing to a plant with dark, crinkled leaves. "Spinach gives you super strength, like a superhero! You see, it’s loaded with vitamins and minerals.”

"Really?" Grace asked, her eyes widening. "Like, I could lift a really heavy rock?"

Grandma Willow chuckled again. “Well, perhaps not a giant rock, but spinach helps your muscles and bones be strong, so you can do lots of fun things." She then pointed to another plant. "And this, my dear, is kale. It’s a bit tougher, but it's also packed with goodness.”

Grace wrinkled her nose. “It looks… tough.”

"It can be, but we can cook it in a way that makes it delicious! We can make crispy kale chips, like you would make with potato chips. Or we can chop it up and add it to soups." Grandma Willow gestured toward another group of plants. "These are romaine lettuce, similar to the one that’s sprouting. We can use them for salads, which are yummy, like strawberry salads!”

Grace, perked up. Salad had just moved up a notch on her interest scale.

“And over here,” Grandma Willow continued, “we have collard greens. They’re like big, broad leaves that you can use to wrap things up. Or cook slowly to make them tender."

Grace peered at the large, dark green leaves. "Can we eat them all?"

“Oh yes, eventually! But right now, we just want to check on them, and care for them,” Grandma Willow replied. “Look, a tiny snail is nibbling on our new sprout!” She gently scooped up the tiny creature and placed it safely on a nearby bush. "We have to protect our greens."

“How?” Grace asked, eager to help.

“We can water them, pull out the weeds that try to steal their sunshine and nutrients, and keep an eye out for any unwanted guests.” Grandma Willow pulled a small watering can from a shed nearby. “Here, Grace, you can help with the watering. Not too much though; just a gentle shower.”

Grace carefully took the watering can and began to shower the seedlings. "This is fun!"

“Gardening is a wonderful thing,” Grandma Willow said, watching her. "It teaches us patience, responsibility, and about the miracle of growth."

Days turned into weeks, and Grace visited Grandma Willow in the garden every day. She carefully watered the plants, pulling weeds, and excitedly watching the greens grow bigger and stronger.

"Grandma!" Grace called one afternoon, rushing over, her face beaming. “The spinach is huge!”

“It is, isn’t it?” Grandma Willow said proudly. “And the lettuce is looking beautiful.” She showed Grace how to gently harvest the outer leaves of the lettuce plants, leaving the inner leaves to continue growing.

“Can we eat some now?” Grace asked, her eyes sparkling.

"Of course! We'll make a delicious salad." Grandma Willow gathered some plump, ripe tomatoes, and a few other fresh ingredients from the garden. "We'll have spinach, some of the lettuce and those gorgeous tomatoes in our salad!"

That evening, they sat at Grandma Willow’s kitchen table, surrounded by the sweet scent of herbs and fresh produce. Grace had helped wash the vegetables, and she watched with fascination as Grandma Willow prepared the salad.

“First,” Grandma Willow explained, “we wash the greens very carefully, removing any dirt. Then we tear them into bite-sized pieces. We’ll chop up some tomatoes and cucumber. And we can add some carrot too, if you like!”

Grace, feeling very grown-up, carefully chopped a small carrot.

“Now,” Grandma Willow said, whisking together a simple vinaigrette of olive oil, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. “We drizzle this over the salad to make it extra yummy!”

Grace tasted the salad, her eyes widening. “It’s…delicious!”

"See, Grace? Greens can be very delicious, too! We can find all sorts of recipes, and use different things with them," Grandma Willow said, smiling. “We have created a delightful garden!"

They ate the salad, the colours of the greens and tomatoes a vivid contrast to the white plates. Grace devoured every bite.

“Can we have more spinach?” she asked, scraping her plate clean.

“Of course, we can,” Grandma Willow said, happy to refill Grace’s plate.

The next day, they made kale chips together. Grace learned how to massage the kale leaves with olive oil and salt before baking them until they were crispy and delicious. The following week, Grandma Willow showed Grace how to make a collard green wrap, filling the large leaves with cooked vegetables and grains.

As the weeks passed, Grace became a true lover of greens. She knew all the plants in Grandma Willow’s garden by name. She understood how they grew, what they needed, and, most importantly, how delicious they could be. She also enjoyed making friends with the snails and birds that frequented the garden.

One day, a new family moved into the house next door. A little boy, about Grace’s age, peeked over the fence.

“Hi!” he said shyly. “I’m Leo.”

“Hi Leo!” Grace replied. “I’m Grace, and this is my Grandma Willow’s garden!” She gestured proudly to the vibrant rows of greens.

Leo’s eyes widened. “Wow! That’s a lot of plants!”

“It is! And it's full of delicious greens!” Grace exclaimed.

“Greens?” Leo scrunched his nose. “I don’t like greens. They're yucky.”

Grace’s heart sank a little, but then she remembered her own initial dislike for greens. She smiled, knowing she could change his mind.

“But these are different!” Grace said. “Come on, I’ll show you! My grandma is the best gardener in the world! She has lettuce, spinach, kale, collard greens, and even more! And she makes them into the most delicious meals! She also grows yummy strawberries.”

Grace explained how they prepared the food and Leo grew very interested.

Grace and Leo walked together to Grandma Willow, who was busy weeding near the tomatoes. "Grandma, this is Leo. He's our new neighbour!"

Grandma Willow smiled and bent to Leo’s height. “Welcome to the garden, Leo! Would you like to see our greens?"

Leo nodded hesitantly.

Grandma Willow took him on a tour of the garden, pointing out each plant and explaining its benefits. She even let Leo taste a sweet tomato from one of the vines.

“Would you like to help me harvest some lettuce, Leo?” she asked.

Leo’s eyes lit up. He spent the afternoon in the garden, helping to pick lettuce, pulling weeds, and learning about the different plants. He helped stir the mixture that was used to feed the plants.

Later, Grandma Willow prepared a simple salad, and invited both Grace and Leo to share it. Leo, with a little encouragement, took a small bite. He paused, and then he smiled.

“Wow! This is…actually really good!” he said.

Grace giggled. “I told you!”

They both finished their plates of salad. After dinner, they were discussing whether or not there would be ice cream for dessert when Leo’s mother appeared at the fence.

“Leo, darling! It's time for you to come inside."

Leo groaned slightly, but he did what his mother wanted him to do.

"Can I come back tomorrow, Grace and Grandma Willow?" He asked hopefully.

“Of course, you can!” Grace replied.

As Leo ran to join his mother, he turned back to Grace and smiled.

“The greens were great!” he yelled over his shoulder.

Grandma Willow smiled, her heart full. “Well, well. It seems our garden of greens is not only for us.”

And from that day on, Leo and Grace became best friends, and the garden flourished with more children and more laughter. The little garden, once filled with plants, became even more vibrant with the help of all the green-loving children.

The End.
