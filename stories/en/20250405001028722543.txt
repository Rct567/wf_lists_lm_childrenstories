<title>The Lonely Cloud Seeking Friends in the Sky</title>
<body>
“Oh, bother,” sighed Cumulus, a fluffy, white cloud. He floated alone, high above the rolling green hills. “It’s such a lovely day, perfect for… for… being with friends.” He puffed out a little cloud of sadness.

He sighed again, a bigger, rainier sigh this time, which caused a tiny drizzle to plink onto Farmer Giles’ prized pumpkin patch.

"Excuse me!" boomed a voice.

Cumulus jumped. He hadn't realised anyone could hear him, especially not all the way down there. He peered downwards.

"Sorry!" he called down. "Didn't mean to… rain on your parade, or… your pumpkins!"

Farmer Giles, a jolly man with a red face and a straw hat, squinted up at him. "Quite alright, young cloud. A little bit of rain does the pumpkins good! But you sound a bit… lonely up there."

Cumulus nodded sadly. "I am. I wish I had some cloud friends."

Farmer Giles chuckled. "Well, the sky's a big place. Why don't you go and look for some?"

“I… I’m not sure how,” said Cumulus. “I don’t know where to start. I just… float.”

“Hmmm,” pondered Farmer Giles, scratching his chin. “Tell you what. Head towards those big, fluffy ones over there,” he said, pointing towards a cluster of gigantic, cotton-candy looking clouds. "They look friendly."

Cumulus perked up. "Really? You think so?"

"Certainly! They're probably playing games," Farmer Giles said with a wink. "Go on! Introduce yourself!"

Cumulus, filled with a sudden burst of courage, puffed himself up a bit. “Okay! Here I go!” he declared and started floating in the suggested direction.

As he approached the giant, fluffy clouds, he started to feel nervous. They looked so… enormous! And full of thunder. "Maybe," he whispered to himself, "they won't want to be friends with a small cloud like me."

Suddenly, one of the large clouds spoke, a voice like a gentle rumble. "Well, hello there, little one! What brings you floating this way?"

Cumulus squeaked, surprised. “Oh! Um… hello. I… I'm Cumulus. And… I'm looking for friends."

The large cloud chuckled, a sound like distant laughter. “Friends? Excellent! We’re the Stratus Clouds. And this is Cirrus, Nimbus, and Alto. Welcome!” It gestured towards the other clouds.

Cirrus, a cloud that looked like wisps of smoke, waved. “Pleasure to meet you!”

Nimbus, a darker cloud, like the hint of an approaching storm, gave a friendly rumble. “Welcome aboard!”

Alto, a medium-sized cloud with a smooth, grey appearance, nodded. “We’re always happy to make new friends.”

Cumulus felt a surge of joy. “Oh, wow! Really? This is… amazing!”

“So, Cumulus, what do you like to do?” asked Nimbus.

Cumulus thought for a moment. "Well, I like… making shapes! Sometimes I look like a sheep. Other times, a dinosaur! And I like watching the world below.”

Cirrus danced and flowed in the air excitedly. “Ooh! Shaping things is fun! Nimbus here is excellent at making scary monster shapes, and I can do the most amazing feathery birds.”

“Can I try?” asked Cumulus eagerly.

“Of course!” replied Alto. “Here, try puffing out your edges a little. Imagine you're forming a big, bouncy ball!"

Cumulus concentrated. He puffed out his edges, trying to imagine a big, bouncy ball. Suddenly, he started to transform! He grew rounder and fuller, his edges became perfectly smooth.

“Ta-da!” he announced, spinning in a complete circle and now perfectly round and perfectly bouncy.

“Amazing!” cried Nimbus. “Look at that! A perfect ball cloud!”

The Stratus Clouds were clearly impressed. They applauded him with their rumbles, showering him with a very gentle, light drizzle, like a warm welcoming hug.

“I can teach you how to make a sheep!” offered Cirrus, forming a cloud that was exactly like a fluffy sheep.

“And I can help you with the dinosaur roar!” added Nimbus, showing off a terrifying cloud dinosaur shape with incredible detail.

“I think I can assist you with changing colors,” spoke up Alto. “It is fun to witness.”

They spent the entire afternoon playing games. They shaped animals and people, they played hide-and-seek among the other clouds, and even made silly shapes that made each other laugh.

Cumulus felt happier than he ever had before. He had finally found friends. He realised the sky wasn't a big, empty place, but a playground filled with endless possibilities.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky with vibrant colors of orange and purple, Nimbus noticed a new cloud forming near them. It was a Cumulus like Cumulus, only smaller and much shy, hiding behind some very large cirrus clouds.

“Look! Another one!” said Nimbus, pointing with one end. “Looks like a very small Cumulus! Shall we make another friend?”

"Absolutely," said Alto, agreeing. "I do believe that the more clouds the merrier!"

Cumulus, remembering his own earlier loneliness, instantly agreed too. "Yes! Let's go meet her!"

They all gently glided towards the small cloud, being very careful not to appear too big or imposing.

“Hello there,” said Cumulus gently. “Are you new around here?”

The small cloud, whose name turned out to be Luna, peeked out from behind the towering Cirrus. She looked very hesitant, her edges a bit frayed. “H-hello,” she whispered. “I… I haven’t been anywhere before.”

“We are the Stratus Clouds,” said Nimbus, in a soft, reassuring rumble. “We live here with Cumulus. He is new too!”

Luna’s little cloud fluffed up slightly in response to the kindness. "You… you are?" she asked looking directly at Cumulus.

Cumulus smiled at her reassuringly. "I am! We are all friends, and you are very welcome to join us. Don't be scared.” He gently puffed up his form in a wave of a 'hello'.

"W-well, alright then," Luna responded after taking a few moments to build up courage. She emerged from the clouds where she was hiding. Her grey body quickly became brighter from relief.

Cirrus gently began to float closer to her, taking her hand - or at least what felt like hands for the small cloud. “How about we start by forming your favorite thing? What are you interested in?”

“M-maybe… bunnies?” Luna timidly suggested.

“Perfect!” Cirrus exclaimed, excited at the opportunity, and promptly and quickly sculpted a fluffy, adorable bunny.

With Cirrus’s guidance, Luna, and with the supportive encouragement of Nimbus and Alto, slowly began to shape her own cloud. Her first try looked rather blobby. Then she took a moment and went to focus again. Her second attempt was an uneven mass with something resembling rabbit ears but only for a second as Cumulus gently corrected it. In the end, she had done it. All of them together crafted a cloud bunny shape.

The bunnies’ tails twitched and noses twirled playfully, the light playing with them with fantastic shadows and hues that sparkled at times like gems.

As the evening deepened, the clouds slowly changed colours and began to shift positions in unison. The clouds moved from blues to pinks and then on to shades of yellow and oranges as the sun started to fade.
Soon it was time for the friends to head into their evening slumber as the light diminished.

"It was such a lovely day with everyone" said Alto gently.

“Indeed” replied Cumulus with enthusiasm.

"Yes" responded Cirrus and Nimbus in unison.

And so, Cumulus, Luna, and the Stratus Clouds, no longer felt lonely in the vast sky. They knew that even though the sky seemed enormous and often ever-changing, the most important thing in the sky were friends, friendship, and always the joy of playing together. They drifted gently off to sleep, dreaming of new shapes and more fun games, already anticipating the bright new day, together, in the friendly sky.
