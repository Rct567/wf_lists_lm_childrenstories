<title>When Books Came Alive at Night</title>
<body>
Lily loved books more than anything in the world. Her bedroom was a colourful haven filled with towering stacks of them. Fairy tales, adventure stories, books about animals, books about space – she had them all. During the day, Lily would curl up on her bed, losing herself in their pages, her imagination soaring with every turn. But at night, when the moon peeked through her window and the house was silent, something magical happened.

One Tuesday evening, tucked snug in her pyjamas, Lily finished reading ‘The Mystery of the Midnight Orchard’. She sighed contentedly, a dreamy smile on her face. "What a wonderful story," she whispered, placing the book on her bedside table. The room was dim, lit only by the soft glow of her nightlight, shaped like a little star. Lily closed her eyes, ready to drift off to sleep.

Suddenly, she heard a faint rustling sound. *Rustle, rustle...* She sat up, her heart thumping. "Hello?" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Silence. Then, another sound, closer this time. *Tap, tap… clink.* It seemed to be coming from the bookshelf. Lily’s eyes widened. Her heart pounded in her chest like a tiny drummer. She slowly swung her legs over the side of the bed and crept towards the bookshelf.

As she got closer, she could make out murmurs, giggles, and the occasional thud. Her hands, clammy with a mixture of excitement and fear, reached for the edge of the bookshelf. She took a deep breath and peered over.

What she saw made her gasp. The books! They were alive!

The cover of ‘The Mystery of the Midnight Orchard’ was propped open, and tiny figures – the characters from the story – were gathered around a miniature apple tree, chattering and laughing. The detective, a stout man with a magnifying glass, was examining a tiny, perfectly formed apple that had fallen to the ground. The villain, a shifty-eyed fox, was trying to sneak up and steal the apple, his furry tail twitching with mischief.

Lily’s jaw dropped. She couldn't believe her eyes!

Beside them, in the children’s corner, the Gruffalo from the book 'The Gruffalo' by Julia Donaldson was munching on a small, crumbly biscuit while a tiny mouse, looking absolutely terrified, peered out from behind a mushroom. The Gruffalo looked bigger than life-sized, in his world.

Further along, from the animal section, a lion from 'The Lion King' was practicing his roar. It sounded like a squeaky puff of air that faded away too quickly, but he kept on trying. Next to him, the very patient giraffe was nibbling leaves from a make-believe tree, all of a few centimetres high. They looked exactly as she had imagined them!

Then her gaze shifted. In the fantasy corner, there was a princess with flowing golden hair and a knight wearing shining armour. The knight was trying to teach a mischievous dragon how to breathe a puff of smoke.

She couldn't help herself; she leaned closer, drawn into their vibrant world. She forgot all her fears, swept up in the wondrous sight before her.

The detective from ‘The Mystery of the Midnight Orchard’ looked up and, noticing her, tipped his tiny hat. “Good evening, young lady,” he squeaked in a voice so quiet Lily could barely hear it. “We’re investigating the mysterious disappearance of the orchard’s most prized apple.”

The fox glanced at Lily and then back at the apple, his eyes darting around nervously.

"Wow," Lily breathed, completely awestruck. "It's…it's amazing!"

The knight, hearing Lily, sheathed his toy-sized sword and saluted. “Greetings! Welcome to our secret night world. You must be Lily?”

Lily nodded enthusiastically. She could talk to them! “How…how do you do this?” she stammered, her voice filled with wonder.

“Ah,” said the Gruffalo, munching happily, crumbs dusting his chest, “It's the magic of the night, and the magic of the stories themselves. Once everyone’s asleep, we come to life, and we make our own adventures!”

“And the books are the doorways," the princess added, pointing towards the spines. “Each story holds a world of its own, just waiting to be explored!”

Lily's eyes scanned the room again, taking in everything, her senses tingling. “Can I… can I help?” she asked timidly.

The knight smiled. "Indeed! In this very moment, the adventure can be anything and anyone! Anything your imagination desires is more than welcome here.”

From that night on, Lily’s nights were transformed. Each evening, she’d creep from her bed and go to her bookshelf. First, she would say, “Good evening, adventurers!” and each time she would see that wonderful activity unfold once more. Sometimes, they were the protagonists in their own stories, sometimes just spectators of each others, all in pursuit of fun and mischief. She helped the detective find the apple by suggesting where it might have rolled. She gave the princess and the dragon some tips for getting that smoke right by explaining where the smoke in her kettle went to each morning. She got the fox to confess that he didn't want the apple for himself, but rather for the small, very hungry rabbits in the story and got everyone to share. She gave advice about what the Gruffalo liked to eat, which turned out to be all the favourite snacks. Each of the stories began to interconnect, the Gruffalo would find out he had eaten the apple after his meal, then they would have the apple as the final shared dessert. Lily became a part of their world, offering her imagination, her ideas, her knowledge and her friendship.

One night, the characters asked Lily a question: what else would she want to do? She got thinking and came up with something, then brought them over, from all of the books, all of the materials that were needed. They spent a night building a castle together out of old shoeboxes and toilet paper rolls. It became the new meeting point, where the characters gathered.

As the weeks turned into months, Lily's adventures with the books continued. But soon, something was off.

One night, she awoke and crept over to her bookshelf, full of anticipation. But when she looked, the bookshelf was silent and still. No characters, no murmur, no magic.

Lily gasped. "Hello?" she whispered, her heart pounding. "Are you there?"

Nothing.

She felt a prickling sensation behind her eyes. This wasn’t right. What had happened? Had she imagined it all?

She began to explore her books to find if anything had changed. But when she did, she found that something had, as some of her characters were missing from their books. She was worried now and decided to seek answers.

She examined 'The Mystery of the Midnight Orchard', there was no detective and the orchard was empty, just a few apple slices on the ground. From 'The Gruffalo', both the Gruffalo and the Mouse were missing. There was also no Lion from 'The Lion King', Princess or Dragon.

Her breath caught in her throat, she felt awful. She couldn’t lose her friends.

That night, instead of going to bed, she remained there, studying each and every book she could find. She realized something then. Some books, the new ones, were untouched and in immaculate condition. They never were touched. However, the old books were tattered, corners folded, and pages slightly ripped. Lily started to work. She carefully glued the corners, smoothed the pages, and cleaned the covers. She even designed small bookmarks to prevent further wear and tear. After finishing, she put each book into her new wooden crate.

The next night, Lily lay in her bed, feeling anxious. But eventually, the magic returned, in a wonderful show of lights and sparks that she thought she may have been imagining. The characters were back and Lily found that she could now help and maintain their presence here.

When she entered the castle she had built and found them sitting around a tiny campfire in the courtyard. They beckoned her over.

“Lily,” the knight said, his voice filled with a quiet urgency. “We felt a chill. Without your caring, the books are slowly falling apart. We lose all that helps us stay. We need you to help care for them, otherwise we face an end."

Lily realised that if she had cared for the books then she would have been more proactive for her friends. It took the night and after some thought, she was ready to assist again. From then on, after reading a book, Lily would carefully put it away and fix it up. She decided to start a small workshop near her bookshelf where she carefully put the new books away safely and lovingly, ready to find her way again.

Lily’s secret was safe, the stories thrived.

She continued to help each of them find their way through the adventures. Sometimes, her night-time world changed, with the additions of many new books and characters that lived within them. However, the most amazing thing of all, Lily could still hear those gentle tap tap sounds, the faint giggles, and the happy cheers. This taught Lily to always be prepared, never to be complacent, because even for her friends in their fantasy worlds, they would have some dark, hard moments if they were to have problems.

Lily kept caring, and the books kept living on forever, all because she cared about the magic in each and every one.
