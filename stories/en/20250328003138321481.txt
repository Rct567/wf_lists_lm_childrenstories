<title>The Grateful Ghosts' Gifts Given Gloriously Grandiose.</title><body>
"Barnaby Button!" boomed a voice, echoing through the attic.

Barnaby, a freckled boy of ten with a perpetually curious gaze, yelped and dropped the dusty music box he was examining. "Who's there?" he stammered, dusting himself off.

Another voice, softer this time, replied, "Don't be alarmed, Barnaby. We are… residents."

Barnaby squinted into the dim, cobweb-laden corners of the attic. "Residents of… what?"

"Of the… the ethereal plane!" the first voice boomed again, with a distinct, slightly shaky timbre. "And of this very attic, naturally."

Slowly, a shimmering shape began to coalesce near a stack of moth-eaten tapestries. It wobbled and flickered, gradually resolving itself into the form of a portly gentleman in a rather dashing waistcoat. He winked, revealing a complete lack of eye sockets, a somewhat unsettling detail.

"Good heavens," Barnaby breathed, backing away slightly. "You’re… a ghost!"

A second shimmering form, this one delicate and translucent, fluttered forward from behind a grandfather clock. She resembled a woman, possibly of some elegant breeding, with a shimmering, translucent gown. She offered Barnaby a spectral curtsy.

"Indeed," she replied, her voice like tinkling chimes. "We are, as you perceive, phantasmal beings. And we have been… watching you, Barnaby."

"Watching me?" Barnaby asked, thoroughly perplexed. "For… how long?"

The portly gentleman, whom Barnaby mentally dubbed 'Mr. Rumples,' puffed out his non-existent chest. "Oh, quite some time! Ever since you started your explorations. We are particularly pleased with your adventurous spirit!"

The lady, who Barnaby secretly named 'Madam Seraphina,' gently corrected, “'Delighted' might be a better word, dear Barnaby. And yes, quite some time. We felt it was time to… bestow upon you a gift.”

"A gift?" Barnaby repeated, completely bewildered. Ghosts giving gifts? He hadn't expected *that* from a dusty old attic.

"Indeed!" Mr. Rumples declared. "But not just *any* gift, young man. Oh no! We’ve decided, in our spectral benevolence, to give you *three*!"

"Three?" Barnaby gasped. This was getting more bizarre by the second.

Madam Seraphina gestured with a spectral hand. "And magnificent ones, at that! Now, first, for your courage and curiosity… a quill that never runs dry and writes stories beyond imagining!"

With a flourish, she conjured a shimmering quill pen and gently floated it towards Barnaby. It gleamed with an otherworldly light.

Barnaby hesitantly reached out and took it. The quill felt surprisingly solid. He held it carefully, marveling at its intricate, glowing details.

"Thank you," he mumbled, hardly believing this was real.

Mr. Rumples cleared his non-existent throat. "For your inherent kindness and open heart, we present you with… the Everlasting Lolly!"

And, with another dramatic flourish, he produced a single, shimmering lollipop that radiated a sweet, fruity aroma. It was enormous, bigger than Barnaby’s head, and sparkled with every color imaginable.

"It… it never melts?" Barnaby asked, utterly mesmerized.

"Precisely!" Mr. Rumples chuckled, a spectral rumble. "It always tastes exactly as it does now, perfect in every single respect, forever."

Barnaby could barely speak. He wanted the lolly so badly, and even knew what it was now.

Madam Seraphina gave Barnaby the final gift with a beaming smile. "And finally, for your adventurous spirit and willingness to help others… the Pocket Portal!"

This final gift was quite the most intriguing. A pocket-sized object. It looked like a tiny, ornate brass key.

"Where do you put this pocket portal, Madam?" Barnaby enquired curiously.

"In your pocket, dear boy!" Madam Seraphina twinkled, showing a phantom, yet still very alluring, smile. "Simply grasp it firmly, think of a place, and… *poof*! You're there!"

"Wow!" Barnaby exclaimed, wide-eyed. He knew instantly he would visit the Amazonian rain-forest, the planet Pluto and back to the beginning of time itself! The possibilities!

"Now, before we… dematerialize back to the ethereal realm," Mr. Rumples said, glancing about the attic, "we must make clear certain stipulations."

Barnaby perked up. "Stipulations?"

Madam Seraphina nodded. "Yes, child. The Quill is only to be used for sharing joy, laughter, or information that benefits the world. The Lolly is to be shared with those in need. And the Portal must not be used for frivolous gain, or… for traveling back in time for purposes of profit, understood?"

"Of course," Barnaby agreed, his eyes still glued to the glittering gifts. "I… I wouldn’t dream of it!"

"Excellent," Mr. Rumples stated.

"We are pleased that you are able to demonstrate your gracious acceptance of these presents, Barnaby," said Madam Seraphina.

"Be responsible with our gifts, and let goodness lead your journeys!" added Mr. Rumples.

With a final smile and a nod, the two shimmering ghosts began to fade. Mr. Rumples vanished first, with a loud 'poof!' and Madam Seraphina gave one final, gentle curtsy, her image slowly disappearing with her goodbye. "Farewell, Barnaby!"

And then, silence descended upon the attic, the only sound the gentle patter of dust motes. Barnaby, clutching the magical quill, the everlasting lolly, and the pocket portal, sat absolutely stunned for what must have been some considerable amount of time.

Finally, he jumped to his feet, heart pounding. He picked up a piece of parchment, dipped the quill in the inkpot (which was, fortunately, already present), and started writing:

“Once upon a time…”

Days turned into weeks. Barnaby wrote countless stories with his magical quill, creating worlds filled with kindness and joy. He gave away pieces of the everlasting lolly, bringing smiles to the faces of everyone, and those in need, he shared his lolly and they returned again and again for another dose of joy. He secretly enjoyed every bite of that gigantic confection himself.

The Pocket Portal became an incredible journey. He visited lost civilizations, saw the wonders of the universe, and even, using careful consideration, found ancient knowledge and helped save an orphaned family who had been struggling with extreme illness and financial difficulties, using this information.

One day, years later, when Barnaby was grown and with a great and generous personality, he returned to the attic. He found the music box that he dropped on the floor again, years previously. The gifts were still in their designated, careful positions.

He heard a soft chuckle and the sound of tinkling chimes. Mr. Rumples and Madam Seraphina materialized, slightly clearer this time, with some minor ghostly renovations and remodels.

"Well done, Barnaby," Mr. Rumples boomed proudly.

Madam Seraphina nodded, a warm, happy glow emanating from her. "You have honored our gifts and used them with remarkable generosity."

"And," added Mr. Rumples, "you never used the pocket portal for personal profit or for profit in general! A truly ethical endeavour for such an endeavour-able boy!"

Barnaby smiled, knowing that his kindness was the best gift he could have given the world.

"I have you to thank for all of this," he said sincerely. "Your gifts… they changed everything."

The ghosts beamed at him, a ghostly warmth filling the attic.

"Now, tell us all of the things you have seen," said Madam Seraphina.

And so Barnaby, once more, and with great delight, spoke of his tales and travels with his old, spectral and new-found friends…
