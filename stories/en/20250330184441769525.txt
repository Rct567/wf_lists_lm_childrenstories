<title>The Vampire Who Loved Sunlight for Some Reason.</title>
<body>
“Professor Nightshade!” squeaked a small voice.

A tall, rather elegant vampire with a shock of white hair and perfectly tailored midnight-blue velvet robes looked down from the balcony of his towering castle. It wasn’t a particularly spooky castle, mind you. No gargoyles or cobwebs in sight. It looked more like a well-loved library with a particularly enthusiastic gardener.

“Barnaby,” Professor Nightshade sighed, adjusting his spectacles. Barnaby was a tiny bat, no bigger than Professor Nightshade's thumb. He always sounded worried.

“Are you… are you sure about this, Professor?” Barnaby fluttered nervously, his tiny wings whirring.

“Of course, I’m sure, Barnaby. This is the annual Sunbeam Picnic! What's to be unsure of?” Professor Nightshade gestured grandly with a gloved hand towards the brightly lit meadow that stretched out before the castle. Wildflowers bloomed in every colour imaginable. The air hummed with the sound of bees and laughter. It was, by all accounts, a perfect, sunny day.

Barnaby flapped closer, landing on the professor’s shoulder. "But... sunlight, Professor! For a vampire! It's… it's…”

“Completely delightful,” Professor Nightshade finished, beaming. He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of honeysuckle.

“Delightful for everyone *else*, Professor!” Barnaby insisted, practically vibrating with anxiety. "We're *vampires*! We're supposed to *hate* sunlight! Burn! Dissolve! Become sparkly… things… depending on the lore you choose to believe!”

Professor Nightshade chuckled. “And yet, here I am. You do know I’ve been doing this for, oh, several centuries now, yes?”

“Yes, Professor. We all know,” Barnaby mumbled, “But… but *why*?”

Professor Nightshade sighed again. “That, my dear Barnaby, is an excellent question. A very important question. And the answer, I’m afraid, is quite simple.” He tapped his chin thoughtfully. "Because I like it."

Barnaby chirped, aghast. “You *like* the sun, Professor? But… but your skin!”

“My skin,” the Professor said cheerfully, pulling back his sleeve slightly, “is perfectly fine. It merely develops a delightful tan.” He winked. "Rather fetching, I think.”

Barnaby let out a tiny squeak and clutched at Professor Nightshade's collar.

From across the meadow, a little girl with pigtails and a bright red dress waved at them. Her name was Lily, and she was Professor Nightshade’s best friend. She didn’t know he was a vampire, and he preferred to keep it that way.

“Are you coming, Professor Nightshade?” Lily called, her voice ringing with excitement. “The jam tarts are ready!”

“Just a moment, Lily!” Professor Nightshade called back, then turned to Barnaby. “See? This is why we have the Sunbeam Picnic, Barnaby. Good company, delicious food, and… well, sun. Now, stop fussing and let’s go.”

“But… but… the garlic bread!” Barnaby wailed. "Are you *sure* the other guests have remembered to… avoid it this year?” Garlic, a vampire's mortal enemy. Professor Nightshade was very careful to ensure the menu was always, *always* garlic-free.

Professor Nightshade adjusted his spectacles and smiled. "Barnaby, I planned the menu, and every item, from the lemonade to the little cakes, are strictly garlic-free. We've had to politely request our werewolf guests leave their pungent seasoning at home.”

Reluctantly, Barnaby agreed. They floated (Professor Nightshade's preferred method of locomotion) across the meadow to join Lily.

The Sunbeam Picnic was a grand affair. Children played games, adults chatted, and everyone, it seemed, was genuinely enjoying themselves. Lily and Professor Nightshade sat under a large oak tree, sharing a blanket covered in sandwiches and tarts.

“Professor,” Lily asked, popping a strawberry into her mouth, "Why do you love picnics so much?"

"Oh, Lily, it is a treat to spend time among your kind. You have so many things in your lives, and you share them together with laughter." The Professor said happily as he spread some jam on a scone. "And, well, picnics are just splendid. The food, the company, the lovely weather... It's all rather enchanting."

"I thought you liked picnics and gardening." said Lily. "Because all I ever see you doing is one or the other."

"Gardening is my true escape, child," replied the Professor. "It is in gardening I can relax my heart's longings."

Lily giggled. "That's the fanciest way to say 'I like to potter around in the garden'. But what if it rains? Surely it's not as wonderful then, is it?"

Professor Nightshade tilted his head, considering. "Ah, rain can be magical, too. Although, truth be told, I prefer the sun. The rain brings out the bugs I would prefer to be out of sight." He glanced at his pristine lawn, momentarily regretting how much of the day was given over to weeding.

Suddenly, a shadow fell over them. A young boy with shaggy brown hair and freckles stood behind them.

“Professor Nightshade? Can I… can I sit with you?” the boy asked, fidgeting with his hands. His name was Tom, and he was a bit shy.

“Of course, Tom!” Professor Nightshade said warmly. “Please, join us. We have plenty of goodies to share.”

Tom blushed and sat down, clutching a small, wilting daisy.

“That’s a beautiful flower, Tom,” Lily said kindly. “Did you pick it yourself?”

Tom nodded, then stammered, "I... I wanted to give it to… you.” He held out the daisy towards the professor.

Professor Nightshade blinked in surprise. “For me? How very thoughtful, Tom. Thank you.” He gently took the daisy. He sniffed it experimentally, his brow furrowing for a moment. “Ah, this scent reminds me of another time and place, a garden full of vibrant reds.”

Barnaby suddenly zoomed in, circling around the daisy. "Professor! That's a… a garlic daisy!" He shrieked, as his eyes went wide and he tried to swat at the professor's hand, clearly fearing for the worst. "He got him!"

Professor Nightshade didn’t react to the tiny bat's concern. He wasn't concerned. His grip, on the daisy, tightened slightly.

Tom’s eyes widened, and he looked deeply saddened. "Oh... is that a problem? I didn't know it was... I'm sorry.”

Professor Nightshade leaned closer to Tom and said calmly. "I sense no harm in you, and I shall take this from you regardless."

Barnaby looked even more perplexed, the other children went silent. Lily grabbed Professor Nightshade’s hand. “Are you alright, Professor?”

The professor gave a gentle smile. “Perfectly fine, Lily.” He then turned to Tom and looked up at him. "Your present to me will not go to waste," said the Professor. He brought the daisy to his mouth and ate it whole.

Tom looked on with widened eyes and with all the other children, unsure of what to do.

Professor Nightshade finished the flower and gave a cheerful smile, completely unaffected.

Barnaby swooped down and landed on the picnic blanket. “Professor! What were you…?” he gasped, still bewildered. “You actually ate the… the garlic!”

“Indeed, I did, Barnaby.” The Professor wiped his mouth with a napkin. “And you, young Tom, are a true friend. Tell me, do you mind sharing any of your thoughts?”

Tom was a bit bewildered by this sudden turn of events. “Um… no, sir. Not at all, I think."

“Wonderful! Close your eyes, Tom.” said Professor Nightshade, “We have many more picnics in store!”

Tom and the others did as they were told. Slowly, Professor Nightshade let his eyes close too, and for what seemed like several minutes, they all went very silent.
Slowly, with a faint light on their faces, Tom's eyes opened once again.

"That was.. magical, Professor." Tom said. "I didn't know things like that were possible. My own grandmother told me, that she was… special."

“That makes perfect sense,” Professor Nightshade replied, his voice now filled with a hint of knowing and even the sunlight seemed brighter around them.

Lily, too, began to understand. "Professor, you knew the whole time, didn't you? About Tom and his… unique… abilities?"

“Indeed, I did, Lily. Just a hint of what may one day become.” He winked at Tom.

Barnaby, finally understanding, chirped with glee. “So, the Professor eats flowers with magical properties, has secret friendships, is not an ordinary vampire… and most of all, just loves a good party.”

Professor Nightshade straightened his robes. "Well said, Barnaby! And now, if you will excuse me, I believe I spotted a particularly delightful lemon tart..."

He stood up, dusting himself off. The Sunbeam Picnic continued in full swing. The vampire, who, for some reason, adored sunlight, smiled, and all his companions smiled with him. The party moved on, to the end of the day. They talked until the sunset went away, and it was time for them to start dreaming for the next time.
