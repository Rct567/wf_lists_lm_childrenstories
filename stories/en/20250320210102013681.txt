<title>The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter and the Secret of the Murmuring Waves Today.</title><body>

Once upon a time, nestled snugly on a very windy, very wobbly island called Wigglebottom Island, lived a lighthouse. Not just any lighthouse, mind you, but the brightest, blinkiest, most bubbly lighthouse in the whole wide sea! And living in the lighthouse, with its keeper, a kind man with a beard that tickled seagulls, lived a little girl named Poppy Buttercup Beanstalk (yes, that was her full name).

Poppy wasn't just any little girl either. She was incredibly curious, a professional question asker, and a connoisseur of cloud shapes (her favourite was the one that looked like a giant, fluffy marshmallow). She loved her father, Old Man Fitzwilliam, and she loved the lighthouse, especially the enormous, glittering lens that kept the ships safe from crashing into the jagged, grumpy-looking rocks surrounding Wigglebottom Island.

Now, every morning, Old Man Fitzwilliam would polish the lens with a special, secret polish made from seaweed and sunshine (it smelled faintly of salty lemonade). And every evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink, he'd carefully switch on the light, making it blink and beam across the inky ocean.

But Poppy noticed something peculiar. For as long as she could remember, she’d heard the waves around Wigglebottom Island murmuring. Not the usual crashing and roaring, but actual murmuring, like tiny, watery whispers.

"What are they saying, Papa?" she'd ask, her nose practically glued to the lighthouse window.

Old Man Fitzwilliam would chuckle, stroking his beard, and say, "Ah, those are just the waves talking to themselves, Poppy-kins. They're always gossiping about the silly crabs and the sleepy starfish."

Poppy wasn't entirely convinced. She'd spent countless hours listening, leaning close to the windows, her ear pressed against the cold glass. Sometimes, she thought she heard the words. “Salty… biscuits… sandcastles…" Other times, it sounded more like, "Bubble… giggle… squid…" It was all very mysterious.

One blustery Tuesday morning, after a particularly turbulent night, Poppy decided she’d had enough. She woke up before the seagulls even started their morning squawks. While her father was still snoring like a grumpy walrus (Old Man Fitzwilliam had the loudest snore on the island!), Poppy crept out of her little bedroom and tiptoed towards the lighthouse engine room. She’d always been forbidden to go in there. "It’s for grown-ups," her father always boomed, "and has important clanking and whirring things."

Ignoring the "no-go" zone signs and a rather menacing-looking octopus-shaped door handle (it looked like it wanted to grab her!), she sneaked inside. The engine room was a chaotic wonderland of pipes, levers, and blinking lights. The air smelled of oil and adventure.

She carefully made her way around the room, dodging a giant spinning cog that looked like it might munch on a small girl if she wasn't careful. She saw a large, bubbling tank of what looked like... custard? Next to the tank sat a series of levers, and her little brain began working overtime.

After checking that no one else was around, Poppy pulled a lever. It was painted red and adorned with the word “CAUTION!” A loud CLUNK echoed through the room. Nothing seemed to happen at first. She looked at the lever. She wriggled it again and again, but still, nothing. 

But then, she heard the murmur of the waves grow stronger. Louder. She held her breath and leaned to listen closely, closing her eyes.

"...Belly…Button…Sand…"

This was promising.

Suddenly, something else caught her attention. On a small, dusty table at the far side of the room, she spotted an ancient, leather-bound book. She crept towards it, heart thumping like a drum solo. The cover was blank, and there were no clues to what the book contained. A single, elegant feather lay on top. 

She gently picked up the feather. It was a bright shade of turquoise and shimmered slightly in the flickering light. Then, carefully, she opened the book.

The pages were filled with strange symbols and swirling patterns. At first, they didn't make sense, but then, slowly, as she ran her fingers over the ink, a hidden phrase started to form on the first page. Poppy looked on in astonishment as the words began to arrange themselves. 

She struggled to decipher the mysterious markings, but after a long, tedious process, she figured out that the page said.

“THE SECRET OF THE MURMURING WAVES TODAY”

Turning the page, Poppy found more complicated patterns. After trying a whole variety of positions and rotations to align the words with what was there, she finally read.

"LISTEN, DEAR LIGHTKEEPER'S DAUGHTER, FOR THE KEY IS ALWAYS NEAR. TO UNDERSTAND THE OCEAN’S SECRETS, BRING THE WIND AND CLEAR."

“The wind?” Poppy asked out loud, confused. What did the wind have to do with anything? But then she thought about it. Old Man Fitzwilliam had said, the secret to the lens shine was seaweed and sunshine! The sea was clearly at play here, too. The connection with the murmuring waves and this hidden text and… could it all be tied in together?

Looking down at the pages, a new understanding dawned on her. "The custard!"

She hurried to the tank of custard and gazed upon it, baffled. Nothing was written about the custard on the page. Why was it so big? But she realised she had an answer.

The answer was the octopus-shaped door handle!

Poppy carefully lifted the feather off the book and walked with it to the door. Holding the feather, she unlocked the door with the handle and ran outside. The wind instantly swirled around her. She looked out at the sea. And that's when she saw it. In the middle of the sea stood a giant, jelly-shaped blob that wobbled back and forth. It was a very large Jellyfish. 

That's it, the Jellyfish! They were trying to help me understand. So I need a way to help them out. I’m on a mission. Poppy realized, then ran back inside, trying not to make any noise, and returned to the book, where she reread what was there. “LISTEN, DEAR LIGHTKEEPER'S DAUGHTER, FOR THE KEY IS ALWAYS NEAR. TO UNDERSTAND THE OCEAN’S SECRETS, BRING THE WIND AND CLEAR.” What was it? How do I know if it’s clear enough?

Suddenly, a lightbulb switched on in Poppy’s head. Of course! It was about the lighthouse.

Poppy quickly rushed to the engine and pulled the lever once more, looking at it nervously. She expected the book to have been wrong, for the murmurs to not be linked. But her father always said the lights bring clear weather in.

CLUNK. This time, a small sound was made.

She rushed to the window to listen again, her heart pounding like a hummingbird's wings. The murmuring began.

"...Help… Jelly… Today…"

Now the whispers were clear, and very urgently, she had a mission: they wanted to have their problems with Jellyfish resolved today! But how? They couldn’t speak to her to communicate exactly what they needed, even if they could speak in her own tongue.

Running from room to room again, this time checking the book, it clicked into place! She was a Lightkeeper’s Daughter! She remembered an important detail.

The custard was in the engine.
The engine operated the lighthouse!
If the lighthouse was powered by the custard...
Poppy stared down the glass, realising her plan. All that was left was execution.

After what felt like an eternity of clanking and whirring, she reached the right controls. But the power went off, the waves stopped murmuring. She went to the tank and removed what was now a cold custard and poured it onto the machine that the lens spins on, and a blast of energy surged through the lighthouse!

Outside, the light from the lens, which usually just went round, started shining onto the large Jellyfish. She was a Lightkeeper’s Daughter! Her eyes watered up. Poppy's solution had worked. The murmuring waves would no longer need help, and Wigglebottom Island, and the secret to her lighthouse. The jelly-shaped blob stood in place. All day.

She glanced back at her sleeping father. Then looked outside one last time at the sea.

Finally, at the end of a very long, extraordinary day, Old Man Fitzwilliam woke up. He went straight to his special polish, expecting the lens to have the same look as always, when he noticed something peculiar about it. He turned the lights on, it began spinning in the air, beaming out in a weird direction!

"Poppy?" he called, noticing that his precious polish was missing from his side table, and he looked in the direction of his daughter's bedroom, but as he walked towards the door, a note had been left for him. "Papa, I solved the riddle today! I hope you enjoy, and thanks, Poppy."

And that's how Poppy Buttercup Beanstalk, the lighthouse keeper's daughter, learned the secret of the murmuring waves. And that, my friends, is the end of the story of today.
