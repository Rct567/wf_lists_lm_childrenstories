<title>The Story of the Little Bear Who Lost His Roar</title><body>Barnaby Bear was, you see, a very loud bear. Not just "boo!" loud, or "whee!" loud, but *roaring* loud. His roar could shake the honeycombs from the tallest trees, ruffle the feathers of the choosiest of cockatoos, and even – according to his Granny Bear – curdle the cream in Mrs. Higgins’ teacups (though Barnaby suspected Granny was exaggerating *just* a little).

Barnaby loved to roar. He roared when he woke up (to say hello to the sun), he roared when he ate his breakfast (a particularly enthusiastic "Good Morning Oatmeal!"), and he roared when he played with his bestest friend, Penelope Possum (to demonstrate his superior bouncy-ball-catching skills, naturally).

One sunny Tuesday (the sun was particularly sparkly that day), Barnaby awoke with a stretch and a yawn. He opened his mouth, ready to unleash his usual earth-trembling, tree-wobbling, cream-curdling roar… but nothing came out.

Instead of a magnificent "RRROOOOOOAAAARRRR!", a tiny, squeaky, almost-undetectable “eep” escaped.

Barnaby blinked. He tried again. "EEP!"

He wiggled his nose. He jiggled his ears. He puffed out his chest. He even stood on his tippy-toes. But all that emerged was a series of pathetic, barely-there "eeps."

Barnaby was horrified. He scrambled out of bed and ran to the nearest mirror (which happened to be a large, shiny mushroom). He opened his mouth as wide as it could possibly go, picturing the biggest, grandest, most rip-roaring roar he could imagine… and then, he squeaked. "Eep."

Tears welled up in Barnaby's eyes. He *had* to get his roar back. How could he greet the sun with an "eep"? How could he show off his bouncy-ball-catching skills with an "eep"? How could he, most importantly, impress Penelope Possum with an "eep"?

He decided, with a determined sniffle, that the best thing to do was seek help. He packed a picnic basket (containing extra-sticky honey cakes and several handfuls of juicy blueberries, for courage) and set off on his quest.

First, he went to see Old Man Willow, a wise, ancient, and slightly grumpy tree who lived at the edge of the Whispering Woods. Old Man Willow knew everything (or at least, that’s what he claimed).

Barnaby explained his problem, squeaking his way through the entire sob story.

Old Man Willow listened patiently, his leaves rustling in what Barnaby thought might be amusement. When Barnaby finished, Old Man Willow creaked, "A lost roar, you say? Hmm. Very peculiar. Have you checked behind your ear?"

Barnaby patted behind his ears. No roar.

"Under your paw?"

Barnaby checked. Definitely no roar.

"Inside your tummy?"

Barnaby poked his tummy. Still no roar.

"Perhaps," Old Man Willow sighed, his leaves beginning to droop, "you simply need to… roar more!"

Barnaby looked at him, bewildered. "But... but I *can't*!" he squeaked.

Old Man Willow just shrugged, sighed again (a rustling, leafy sigh that sounded suspiciously like a giggle), and said, "Well, that's all I know, little bear. Good luck!"

Barnaby trudged away, feeling even more despondent. He nibbled thoughtfully on a honey cake, and decided to consult another expert.

Next, he visited Professor Owl, a learned bird with spectacles perched precariously on his feathery nose. Professor Owl had read every book in the Whispering Woods library (which wasn’t a *huge* library, admittedly, but still).

"A lost roar!" Professor Owl exclaimed, adjusting his spectacles with a hoot. "Fascinating! According to my extensive research on the phenomenon of 'Vocal Void'…” he began, pulling out a very large, very dusty tome, “…it is possible that your roar has been… *stolen*!”

Barnaby gasped. "Stolen? By whom? What? Why?"

Professor Owl flipped through the thick book, his spectacles catching the sunlight. "It could be the Giggling Goblins," he said, finally. "They are known to pilfer the sounds of others. Or perhaps..." he paused, dramatically, "...the Murmuring Mice!"

Barnaby felt a shiver run down his spine. Giggling Goblins and Murmuring Mice were the stuff of scary bedtime stories! "What do I do?" he whimpered, clutching his picnic basket.

"You must embark on a quest!" Professor Owl declared, puffing out his chest. "You must venture to the Goblin Grotto or the Mice's Meadow! You must…” he droned on, listing a series of incredibly dangerous and frankly, rather improbable, tasks.

Just as Professor Owl was suggesting Barnaby train a family of squirrels to fly, Barnaby, who was feeling increasingly nervous, politely interrupted. "Thank you, Professor Owl," he squeaked, "but I think I need to think about this for a bit."

He hurried away, convinced that the search for his roar wouldn't be fixed with a quest, but rather his own ideas. He sat down by a babbling brook to eat his honey cakes, thinking hard as he ate, and began to nibble his honey cakes from his small picnic. He munched and crunched until he was out of cakes.

Penelope Possum, meanwhile, was wondering where Barnaby was. She'd been waiting all morning to play bouncy-ball-catch, and Barnaby was usually exceptionally punctual. She decided to go and find him.

She followed his scent, eventually finding him sitting by the brook, looking very sad.

"Barnaby?" she said, her voice filled with concern. "What's wrong?"

Barnaby looked up, his eyes still slightly teary. He tried to explain, but all that came out was a series of pathetic "eeps."

Penelope, being a very understanding possum, didn't laugh, or even giggle. She just sat down next to him and listened patiently. She listened to Barnaby, even though she didn't understand the eeps she was hearing.

Finally, Barnaby, after much effort and deep breaths, managed to squeak out the entire story. He really missed his awesome booming roar. His friends missed his booming roar.

When he finished, Penelope smiled. "Well," she said, "that does sound awfully frustrating." She paused, then said "Try this...pretend you are roaring with your tummy."

Barnaby blinked, confused. "With my tummy?" he squeaked.

Penelope nodded. "Yes! Close your eyes… and imagine that your tummy is the loudest part of your roar. Like you're trying to push all the air out of it."

Barnaby closed his eyes. He thought of the juiciest, most delicious blueberries he'd ever eaten. He thought of his favorite honey cakes. He thought of the feeling of bouncing the bouncy ball *really* high. He focused on his tummy and his favourite things, which was something Penelope had said would help him to get back to normal.

Then, he took a deep breath, imagined the blueberries swilling around in his tummy, then... he pulled his face, and he tried. He pushed, and pushed and...

He let it out.

A small cough emerged. A small cough that became a small gargle. Then a tiny, weak "Rrr…"

Barnaby opened his eyes, and he gave it everything. It still didn't give much out.

Then, he focused. From his tummy, he pushed again. This time he opened the floodgates.

A slightly shaky, but undeniably *present* "ROAR!" emerged.

It wasn't the earth-shattering, tree-wobbling roar he was used to, but it was a roar nonetheless!

Barnaby, still recovering from his big moment roared again.

"RROAAARRRRRR!"

He let out a gigantic bellow.

He ROARED AGAIN!.

Penelope threw her bouncy ball in the air gleefully, and when it landed, Barnaby caught it.

Penelope giggled. "Wow Barnaby! Your roar is back!"

Barnaby beamed. He realized that he didn’t just sound like himself, but he realised the fact that he could trust his own body. He was overjoyed, filled with glee, and felt empowered to overcome his issues after his ordeal.

He had forgotten about the Giggling Goblins and the Murmuring Mice, and remembered that with effort, persistence, and a little bit of help from his best friend, he could do anything.

And as he threw the bouncy ball with his newly recovered roar, he knew that he could always trust his body.

From that day on, Barnaby's roar returned to its full, magnificent glory, albeit with a slightly new origin point. Sometimes, when you listened very closely, you could still hear a little rumble in his tummy before the big, booming "RRROOOOOOAAAARRRR!" – a happy reminder of the day he learned that sometimes, the answer is right inside you, you just have to remember where to find it!.
