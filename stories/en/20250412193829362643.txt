<title>The Snake Who Had No Time for Sneaky Behavior.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst the tall, whispering green trees of Sunny Meadow, lived a snake named Sammy. But Sammy wasn't just any snake; Sammy was a snake of remarkable habits. He absolutely, positively, did not have time for sneaky behavior. While other snakes might slither silently, hide in the shadows, and surprise unsuspecting creatures, Sammy preferred a more… direct approach. He preferred friendly greetings, helpful actions, and loud, enthusiastic announcements!

Sammy was a sunshine snake, always ready with a smile and a friendly “Good morning!” or “How are you doing today?” to anyone he met. His scales shimmered with a bright, happy yellow, catching the sunlight and reflecting it back to the world. He was round and plump, not because he was particularly good at hunting, but because he loved eating the delicious berries that grew wild in Sunny Meadow.

Now, not everyone in Sunny Meadow shared Sammy’s sunny disposition. There was a grumpy badger named Bartholomew, who lived in a dark burrow under a giant oak tree. Bartholomew grumbled and groaned at everything. He disliked sunshine, berries, and, most of all, friendly snakes. He considered Sammy’s boisterous greetings an unbearable nuisance.

"Honestly," Bartholomew would grumble, pulling his blanket of leaves tighter, "That Sammy! Always yapping. Can’t he just *slither* along quietly?"

There was also a clever fox named Finley. Finley was known for his trickery and his love of pulling pranks. He enjoyed outsmarting others and generally causing a bit of playful chaos. Finley would often try to get Sammy to play along with his sneaky schemes.

One sunny morning, Sammy was wiggling his way through the meadow, admiring the dew-covered spiderwebs, when he bumped into Finley.

"Morning, Sammy!" Finley chirped, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Have you seen Mrs. Robin? I have a lovely little prank planned. A nice surprise! Care to join?"

Sammy tilted his head, his tongue flickering out in a thoughtful manner. "Good morning, Finley! What kind of prank? Is it something friendly and helpful?"

Finley chuckled. “Not exactly, Sammy! But it will be fun. I'm planning on swapping the signs! Very very sneaky! Then things will get a bit mixed up and will cause many laughs.”

Sammy frowned, his sunny scales seeming to dim just a bit. “Sneaky is not so good, Finley. What about Mrs. Robin? I would never want her to be unhappy."

Finley waved a paw dismissively. "Oh, she'll get over it. Come on, Sammy, be a sport! We can swap the signposts that guide animals to their food sources! Just imagine the confusion!"

Sammy considered for a moment. He didn’t want to make Mrs. Robin unhappy, but he also wanted to be friends with Finley.

"I don't think that sounds like fun, Finley," Sammy said firmly. "Sneaky actions sometimes hurt people. What about trying a friendly game? Perhaps we could gather berries for everyone instead."

Finley groaned. “Berries? Oh Sammy, you are such a bore!” He twirled around, his bushy tail swishing back and forth. "Fine, fine. I will do it alone. Perhaps next time you will be in the mood for real fun!" And with that, Finley disappeared into the tall grass.

Sammy sighed. He knew Finley was disappointed, but he couldn’t bring himself to participate in something that could cause others grief. He continued on his way, and just moments later saw Mrs. Robin struggling to reach some high-hanging berries for her babies.

"Good morning, Mrs. Robin!" Sammy called out. "Need a little help with those berries?"

Mrs. Robin turned her head and saw Sammy. "Oh, Sammy! That would be wonderful, dear."

Sammy quickly wriggled himself near the bush, and, with a few well-placed twists and turns, he wove his body into a sort of berry-gathering contraption. Then, he carefully bumped into the bush so that berries rolled into his makeshift basket and they were gathered at a reachable height for Mrs. Robin.

"Thank you, Sammy!" Mrs. Robin chirped happily, gathering the berries. "You are such a kind snake!"

Meanwhile, Finley was off on his prank. He stealthily went through the meadow, swapping signposts and snickering to himself as he imagined the chaos that would follow. "The squirrels looking for nuts will go searching for carrots. The rabbits expecting leafy greens will search for seeds. This will be delightful!" he cackled.

Soon enough, the confusion started.

A little squirrel named Squeaky, expecting a delicious pile of nuts at “Nut Knoll,” ended up at “Muddy Pond,” searching for nuts. The rabbits, following the signpost that now pointed towards "Root Rock", instead of finding fresh greens, dug at hard rocks. Other animals were just as befuddled by the swapping of the signposts.

"Where are the delicious carrots?" a confused rabbit hopped near Squeaky.

"Where is that heap of nuts?" questioned a grumbling Squeaky.

Finley, hidden behind a bush, watched the mayhem and burst into giggles. But then, he saw Mrs. Robin flying towards him, clearly distressed.

"Finley!" Mrs. Robin exclaimed. "I was looking for some worms to feed my chicks, but the sign post at Wormy Way is completely out of whack!"

Finley’s laughter died in his throat. He suddenly realized that the “fun” he'd been having was causing real problems. Mrs. Robin was worried about her babies!

He looked over at Sammy, who was carefully helping Mrs. Robin find some delicious and wormy soil. Sammy looked at Finley and gave a comforting nod and welcoming smile. Finley looked back at his sign post plans and felt ashamed. He wanted to do something but was at a loss as to what he should do.

At that moment, Bartholomew the badger lumbered out of his burrow, even grumpier than usual. He had been looking for a patch of juicy earthworms, but had instead stumbled upon a patch of extremely hard, dry soil.

"Blast this!" he grumbled, “All this confusion! I'm famished! What is going on?"

Suddenly, it occurred to Finley. It took an amazing snake, a little bit of shame and some clear thought. He ran to Squeaky the squirrel and began the difficult task of explaining.

"Squeaky, I am really very sorry. My name is Finley. I… I swapped the sign posts for a bit of fun. Please, forgive me."

Squeaky, still very hungry, listened to Finley and then answered with an inquisitive stare. "Really? It was *you*?"

"Yes," Finley answered in embarrassment, ashamed of his sneaky behavior. "I didn't mean for anything to go wrong or make everyone feel confused and hungry. Please, I will fix everything!"

Finley then turned to Mrs. Robin. "I was wrong, Mrs. Robin. I shouldn’t have messed with the signs. I didn’t think about how my actions could cause you problems."

Finley had a big job ahead. He had to set everything right again. He thought that helping Sammy seemed like a very sensible path. He apologized again and told everyone of his new plans to reset the signs.

Finley, Squeaky and Sammy worked as a team. Finley ran around to help reset the sign posts. Sammy called out directions to all the animals. Squeaky had excellent skills at finding all the signs. Soon, all the animals of Sunny Meadow began going back in the right direction.

Meanwhile, Finley, Squeaky and Sammy, were working together to gather delicious berries and worms for everyone. Even Bartholomew, watching them from afar, could not help but feel the edges of a tiny smile pull at his grumpy lips.

"Well," Bartholomew mumbled. "Maybe Sammy isn't so bad after all."

Finley approached Sammy with a small grin. "Thank you, Sammy. You were right. Sneaky isn’t very helpful. You were very friendly. And also, berries are not so bad, too!"

Sammy beamed, his yellow scales shining. "See, Finley? Working together, being kind, and not being sneaky – that is what makes Sunny Meadow a wonderful place!”

Finley smiled back. "You are right, Sammy. You are completely right! And thanks for the good company. I learned something today."

From that day on, Finley and Sammy became the best of friends. Finley, under Sammy’s kind and unwavering influence, largely abandoned his mischievous ways. He still liked a little bit of fun, but his fun was more often directed towards helping others or creating new games that made everyone laugh. Finley found that Sunny Meadow was much better place when everyone was helping out one another and always being nice and considerate. He especially became a regular berry-picking companion. And whenever Finley felt a bit tempted to go back to his sneaky tricks, he would remember Sammy, remember how bad the signs mix-up went, and, with a shake of his head, choose the path of friendly behavior instead.

Bartholomew, even, began to show signs of softening. He still enjoyed his quiet time, but he found that a little sunshine and a friendly greeting from Sammy were not so bad after all. Sometimes, he even ate a few berries, and even occasionally, helped his friends. He was still the grumpy old badger, but he was also now, in his own grumpy way, part of Sunny Meadow's sunshine crew.
