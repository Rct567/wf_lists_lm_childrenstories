<title>Peter Parrot's Perfect Prickly Pear Plight</title>
<body>
“Squawk! Oh dear, oh dear!” chirped Peter Parrot, flapping his brilliant blue wings with a flurry of frantic energy.

"What's all the squawking about, Peter?" asked Rosie Rabbit, nibbling on a particularly plump clover. She twitched her nose, sensing Peter's usual drama.

"It's the prickly pears, Rosie! The prickly pears!" Peter screeched, hopping nervously on a branch of the old oak tree.

"What about them? They're perfectly lovely. Delicious, even," Rosie said, a slight hint of a carrot-colored stain around her mouth.

"Lovely? Delicious? Rosie, you don't understand! They're...they're disappearing!" Peter cried, almost tearing out one of his vibrant tail feathers in his agitation.

Rosie blinked her big, brown eyes. "Disappearing? That's odd. I saw plenty yesterday."

"But today! Today there's barely a single one left with its juicy plump red skin!" Peter exclaimed, bobbing his head. "And the Prickly Pear Party is next week! It's the most important day of the year, Rosie!"

Rosie hopped closer, her ears perked. "The Prickly Pear Party? Oh, that is important. What are you planning on serving, Peter? You're usually the star baker, aren't you?"

"I was going to bake a Prickly Pear Paradise Pie, with a secret ingredient only I know!" Peter announced proudly, puffing out his chest. "Now that ingredient is disappearing with all the prickly pears. Someone or something must be stealing them!"

"Hmm," Rosie hummed thoughtfully, tapping her chin with a paw. "Let's investigate. Follow me!"

Together, Peter and Rosie set off towards the sprawling cactus patch, the source of the threatened prickly pears.

“Keep your eyes peeled, Rosie! This is a mystery of the highest order!” Peter said, his tone regaining some of his customary confidence.

"Alright, Detective Parrot," Rosie replied, smiling. "Where do we start?"

They reached the cactus patch. Normally, it was a vibrant landscape of spiky green plants laden with crimson-red prickly pears. But today…it was patchy, with many bare cactus pads.

“Look at this devastation!” Peter cried dramatically, gesturing with a wing. “Just look at it!”

"Well, it's definitely not as full as usual," Rosie observed. She hopped around carefully, avoiding the sharp spines. "Have you seen any signs of trouble, like footprints or disturbed soil?"

Peter, ever the flamboyant one, dramatically fluttered around. "Footprints? Soil? That's all too boring! We need clues! And I know where to find some!"

He swooped down and started meticulously examining the area. He pecked at the ground, peered under leaves, and sniffed at the base of each cactus. He looked thoroughly puzzled.

"Hmm…nothing," Peter announced finally, defeated. "No footprints, no unusual droppings… nothing!"

“Maybe we need to observe,” Rosie suggested calmly. “Let's hide and watch the cactus patch. We can see who – or what – is taking the pears.”

They found a hiding spot behind a large, barrel cactus, partially sheltered by a thorny bush. They settled down to wait, Peter squawking occasionally with impatience.

"It’s taking forever, Rosie! How much longer must we wait, do you think?"

“Patience, Peter! We must be like the silent shadows to catch a thief, for it is through patience that the most glorious secrets are brought to light,” Rosie said. “It won’t be long, I am sure. Look there!”

Suddenly, a shadow passed over the patch. A pair of small, furry paws appeared.

"It’s…" Peter gasped. "It’s Pipkin! And look there, is his elder brother there too?"

They watched in surprise as Pipkin Squirrel, a young, energetic squirrel they knew well, scurried into the cactus patch followed by his elder brother, a significantly larger squirrel named Captain Nuts. They began to systematically check each prickly pear fruit.

Pipkin began to nibble the skins off a plump red prickly pear, and his brother began to do the same to a slightly less ripe one. They both, slowly but surely, nibbled each delicious red fruit, peeling off the flesh piece by piece.

“Well, now we know who the culprits are,” Peter said, his voice softer now, as if suddenly sympathizing with them.

“Indeed,” Rosie replied. “But why would they do this, I wonder?”

They emerged from their hiding place and approached the two squirrels cautiously.

"Pipkin! Captain Nuts! What are you doing?" Peter asked, trying to sound stern, but his voice lacked its usual force.

The squirrels froze, their tiny paws covered in prickly pear juice. They looked up, surprised, and slightly guilty.

"Oh, hello, Peter…Rosie,” stammered Pipkin, wiping his sticky paw across his face.

Captain Nuts just grunted, attempting to look nonchalant while picking at a lingering piece of skin.

“Are you stealing the prickly pears?” Peter asked, trying his best not to make his face a frown.

Pipkin shifted from paw to paw, his ears drooping. "We...we just needed some. For the winter, you see."

Captain Nuts nodded glumly. "We’re running low on food. It’s going to be a harsh winter, they say.”

Rosie, always the kind one, immediately understood. “Oh, you're gathering food for the winter! That’s important!”

“But...the Prickly Pear Party!" Peter reminded them, a hint of desperation returning to his voice. "My pie!"

Pipkin's eyes widened with distress. “Oh dear! We didn't think!”

"We apologize," Captain Nuts said gruffly, hanging his head. "We didn't realize the prickly pears were so…important."

Rosie turned to Peter, and she suddenly had a solution in mind. She turned to the squirrels and said, "It’s all right, you two. We understand. And Peter, I have a brilliant idea! Peter is going to share his prickly pears with you. And in exchange, you can both help me find some! They would both have more prickly pears. He is sure to make the Prickly Pear Paradise Pie a complete success."

Peter stared at Rosie, utterly flabbergasted, then grinned a little slowly. "Share my prickly pears? Well…" He turned to the squirrels. "Tell you what: We have a deal! I’ll help you find some food and in return you get to help with the pie preparations."

The squirrels’ faces lit up. "Really? Wonderful!" Pipkin exclaimed.

“Yes, yes indeed!” Captain Nuts said with his head held high. “I shall make haste!”

“Alright,” Peter clapped his hands together, excitement returning. “Firstly, Rosie's plan: The sharing will have to start.”

Together, they decided on a plan. They divided the cactus patch, dedicating certain areas for the squirrels' winter supplies and some for Peter's precious pie ingredients.

"You see!" Peter declared, his wings spread wide as they began. “There's room for everyone! My pie will still be made! And the squirrels will have plenty to eat!”

“I agree!” Rosie smiled as she began moving the juicy red fruit of the prickly pears to Peter’s cart.

The next few days were a flurry of activity. Peter, with Rosie’s patient guidance and the squirrels’ enthusiastic help, worked on the prickly pear gathering, along with other supplies for them to use for winter storage. They then gathered ingredients. They made the delicious Prickly Pear Paradise Pie.

Finally, the day of the Prickly Pear Party arrived. The oak tree was decorated with colourful streamers and twinkling fairy lights. Peter, wearing a tiny chef’s hat, beamed as he unveiled his magnificent pie.

"And now, without further ado," Peter announced, gesturing dramatically, "I present to you… the Prickly Pear Paradise Pie!"

Everyone gasped. It was the most glorious pie anyone had ever seen, decorated with swirls of cream and sparkling candied prickly pears. Pipkin and Captain Nuts sat proudly beside the others, savoring their helping alongside everyone else.

“The secret ingredient, is it really that secret?” Rosie laughed and winked at Peter.

Peter, feeling generous and proud, whispered to Rosie, "Of course not."

Everyone devoured the pie with gusto. The prickly pears tasted delicious, even more so because everyone understood that this party meant kindness, consideration, and collaboration! Even those from whom those delicious red prickly pears were hidden now enjoyed them!

As the sun set, casting a warm glow over the oak tree, Peter ruffled his feathers. “Well,” he announced, “I think this Prickly Pear Party has been the best one yet!”

Rosie smiled at Peter. "It certainly has."

Pipkin and Captain Nuts looked from their portions with an overwhelming feeling of belonging. Everyone shared a piece and everyone, in their hearts, enjoyed the prickly pears together!
