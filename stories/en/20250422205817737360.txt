<title>Freddy's First Day at the Farm</title>
<body>
Freddy the fox cub wiggled with excitement. Today was the day! He was finally going to visit Farmer Giles' farm! He had been hearing stories about it for weeks from his older sister, Fiona. Fiona had been there a few times before, helping her friend Rosie who lived near the farm, and she'd regaled Freddy with tales of fluffy chicks, clucking hens, and the tastiest apples he'd ever heard of.

Freddy bounced on his little paws as his mother, Fifi, carefully packed a small picnic basket. It contained some berries, a crunchy acorn, and a juicy worm (a treat only for special occasions, his mother had warned).

“Now Freddy,” Fifi said, her voice soft and a little bit concerned, “remember what I told you. Be polite to the farm animals. Don’t chase the chickens, and absolutely, under no circumstances, go near the big, grumpy bull in the west field.”

Freddy nodded eagerly. He knew all the rules. He wasn’t a silly, disobedient cub. He wanted to make a good impression. “I’ll be the best behaved fox cub ever, Mum!” he promised, his tail swishing back and forth like a happy metronome.

They set off early, the morning mist still clinging to the green fields. As they walked, Fifi pointed out various things: the busy buzzing of bees, the fluttering of colourful butterflies, and the sleepy field mice scurrying for cover.

Finally, after what seemed like an age to Freddy, they reached the farm. The gate creaked open with a loud groan, revealing a scene of delightful chaos. Chickens strutted about, pecking at the ground. Sheep grazed peacefully in a nearby field. And in the distance, Freddy could see a large, red barn.

“Right, young one,” Fifi said, giving Freddy a gentle nudge with her nose. “Off you go and explore, but stay within sight. I’ll be here to watch from the edge of the woods.”

Freddy took a deep breath and trotted onto the farmyard. He was so excited, his whiskers twitched! The first thing he saw was a group of fluffy yellow chicks. They peeped and cheeped, following their mother hen, who clucked protectively. Freddy, remembering his mother's warning, kept a safe distance.

He decided to start with the apple orchard. He had heard so much about the delicious apples. He approached a gnarled old apple tree, its branches laden with bright red fruit. Reaching up on his hind legs, he tried to snatch an apple, but they were just out of his reach.

Suddenly, a small girl with bright pigtails and rosy cheeks came running into the orchard. It was Rosie, Fiona’s friend!

"Hello there!" Rosie called out with a friendly wave. "You must be Freddy!"

Freddy was so surprised; he almost tumbled over! "Yes! That's me!" he squeaked, puffing out his chest.

Rosie giggled. "I'm Rosie. Come on, I'll help you get an apple. Farmer Giles always leaves a few low down for the little ones."

Rosie pointed to a couple of apples within easy reach. Freddy carefully chose a particularly shiny one and took a huge bite. It was incredibly sweet and juicy. He had never tasted anything so good!

"Mmm, delicious!" Freddy declared, apple juice dribbling down his chin.

Rosie smiled. “Farmer Giles grows the best apples around! Why don’t you come and help me with the sheep later? They need fresh water.”

Freddy agreed eagerly. He followed Rosie through the farmyard, his tummy full of apple. They passed the sheep, who were munching on grass in a grassy area. As they approached the trough, they realised the sheep were quite thirsty.

"Hello, sheep!" Rosie greeted, and all the sheep looked up.

They cleaned the water trough and began to fill it with fresh water from a nearby pump. Freddy carefully observed the sheep, who nudged each other gently as they waited for a drink. He thought they looked rather cuddly. He even thought about trying to sneak a sneaky pat, but decided against it as his mum had warned him of getting involved with the sheep as they were easily scared.

As they were working, a loud, grumpy voice boomed, "Oi! What are you two up to?"

Freddy jumped and spun around. He recognised the grumpy voice from the stories he had been told: It was Farmer Giles.

Farmer Giles was a large man with a round belly and a very bushy beard. He had a permanently stern look on his face. Freddy felt a pang of nervousness.

"Hello, Farmer Giles," Rosie said politely, offering a warm smile. "We're just giving the sheep some fresh water."

Farmer Giles grunted. "Good, good. Making yourselves useful, are you?" He then turned to Freddy and scrutinised him with his bright, beady eyes. "And you, young fox. Are you going to cause trouble?"

Freddy stammered, "Oh, no sir! I'm just… visiting."

Farmer Giles continued to examine him with narrowed eyes.

"Well," he boomed eventually, "as long as you're well-behaved. Those chickens are very sensitive and don't need their space to be invaded.” He gave a final glare and stomped away, muttering something about “cheeky foxes.”

Freddy sighed with relief. He realised that Farmer Giles might appear grumpy but he clearly loved his farm and animals. They continued with the watering, Rosie showing him which parts of the equipment was the best to use to maintain it efficiently. They refilled the trough, chatting about the animals and other fun things around the farm.

After watering the sheep, Rosie showed Freddy the pigs. They were surprisingly friendly and enjoyed having their backs scratched with a rough brush. One little piglet kept nuzzling Freddy’s leg, squealing with delight. Freddy was a little hesitant at first, but he eventually leaned in and started to give the piglet gentle scratches.

Later, they decided to head toward the red barn, which piqued Freddy's interest immensely. As they got closer, he noticed something odd: all the cows in the nearby field were staring towards the fence. Following their gaze, he noticed something terrible!

A big, red bull stood in the west field, just as his mum had warned him about!

He looked intimidating! He snorted loudly, pawing at the ground. The bull’s eyes looked even more scary and intimidating than when Freddy had imagined them.

Freddy remembered his mother’s words and froze.

"Oh dear," Rosie whispered. "That's Barnaby, and he's a bit grumpy today. We should probably avoid him."

Freddy nodded vigorously, agreeing entirely. They carefully avoided the bull's field and headed into the barn.

Inside the barn, it was cool and dimly lit. The air smelled of hay and earth. There were rows of stalls, and in each stall, there was a different animal: horses, ponies, and a donkey, all looking rather content.

Rosie explained that the ponies were used for riding, and they got brushed and pampered all the time. The donkey was called Duncan and he loved eating carrots. They stroked the nose of a brown and white horse and went inside the horse's stables. Freddy listened intently to Rosie and her detailed explanations of all the animals.

They helped to clear out some of the hay from the stables and Freddy started helping to sweep with the mini broom Rosie had given him. Freddy swept his small portion of the barn and enjoyed watching Rosie do the same, which kept her company.

Eventually, as the sun began to set, it was time for Freddy to go home. He felt tired but happy. He’d made a new friend, tried the best apple he’d ever tasted, helped Rosie with the sheep and barn, and – most importantly – avoided the grumpy bull!

He found his mother waiting for him at the edge of the woods.

"So, how was your first day, Freddy?" Fifi asked, nuzzling him with her soft fur.

Freddy’s eyes lit up. He excitedly told his mother all about his adventures: the apples, Rosie, the sheep, the pigs, the horses, the donkey, and the grumpy bull. He even tried to imitate Farmer Giles' grumpy voice, which made his mother giggle.

"I'm so proud of you, Freddy," Fifi said, giving him a big cuddle. "You were a very good boy."

As they walked home, Freddy knew this was just the start of many happy visits to Farmer Giles' farm. He couldn’t wait to tell Fiona all about it. And he knew, for sure, that he had discovered his absolute favourite place. He was sure he would never get bored! He just hoped, next time, he could be brave enough to pat a horse.
