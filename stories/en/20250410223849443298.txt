<title>The Giraffe Who Dreamed of Flying like the Birds.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amidst the golden savannah of Africa, lived a giraffe named Gerry. Gerry wasn't like the other giraffes. While they were content munching on acacia leaves, basking in the sun, and casually stretching their long necks to peer over the tall grass, Gerry harboured a secret, a most peculiar desire: he wanted to fly.

Every morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple, Gerry would watch the birds. Swallows, with their darting, graceful movements, circled high above the trees. Eagles, majestic and powerful, soared effortlessly, riding the thermals. And little finches, flitting and chirping, seemed to dance in the wind.

"Oh, to be able to move through the air like them," Gerry would sigh, his long neck drooping slightly.

The other giraffes found Gerry's aspirations quite amusing. "Fly? Gerry, giraffes have long legs for running on the ground, not wings for flying!" chuckled Gerald, the oldest and wisest giraffe in their herd. "That’s what the birds are for, not giraffes. We are made for the land!"

“You can reach the highest branches without stretching! That's an amazing skill already," Gertrude, Gerry’s kind aunt, added soothingly, trying to distract him from his outlandish dreams. “Why want something you can't have?”

But Gerry couldn’t shake his yearning. He spent his days observing the birds, studying their wings, and trying to understand their secret. He’d spend hours leaping and stretching, flapping his ears with all his might, convinced that if he could just get the right technique, he could lift off the ground.

He’d try running fast towards small inclines. Surely, the momentum, the height… he believed it would work! Each time, however, he would simply end up stumbling over the uneven terrain and looking silly in front of the other giraffes, who, even if they tried not to show it, found Gerry's efforts to be somewhat bizarre and a waste of valuable chewing time.

One day, Gerry spotted a particularly skilled falcon. It was perched atop a tall baobab tree, its sharp eyes scanning the savannah. Gerry approached cautiously.

“Excuse me, Mr. Falcon,” Gerry began politely. “I… I was wondering if you could possibly teach me how to fly?”

The falcon, whose name was Finley, turned his keen gaze upon Gerry. He looked at the giraffe's long neck, his spindly legs, and then at the ground. He was puzzled, as he was usually approached by small field mice.

"Teach you to fly? My dear giraffe, that’s… well, that’s not possible," Finley said with a slight chuckle. "You’re a giraffe! You weren’t built for flying. But tell me why are you asking? Is something the matter?"

Gerry explained his yearning, his observations, his attempts, and his ultimate disappointment. He confessed that he wanted nothing more than to experience the freedom of soaring above the trees, to see the world from a bird’s eye view.

Finley listened patiently, his head cocked to one side. When Gerry was finished, Finley took a moment to consider his words. "I understand your desire," Finley said finally, his voice gentle. “I've observed that animals and creatures tend to focus only on what they don't have. A bird can't stretch its neck and pick off an acacia tree top like you can, but we do not let that burden our journey, it's just the way it is. It is simply our way. And this is how you also can get what you need.

“But the best way to approach things is not by wishing to be what you are not but instead trying to improve the things you already are."

Gerry was disappointed. "So, there’s no hope, then?" he asked dejectedly, his long eyelashes casting shadows on the golden grass.

Finley shook his head. "There's always hope, young one, and plenty of other great things that may become available to you, but maybe not the one you wish to gain from this. Flying is a privilege of the sky, you, Giraffe, are of the land. But that doesn't mean you can't experience the joy of flying!"

Gerry’s ears perked up. "Really? How?"

Finley smiled. "You see, the key to happiness isn't always getting what you think you want. It’s about finding what you can truly appreciate, with your unique strengths."

"Tell you what, come with me, you see those clouds over there, how they change the view. The sky can be seen in many ways, come here and watch!"

With a gentle lift of his wings, Finley launched himself into the air, then turned and flew close to Gerry, encouraging him to look up with him. Gerry looked to Finley and then looked up, finally noticing the clouds!

He saw the savannah stretching below him, looking down to the tall grasses and the small acacia trees, this new view gave him another feeling he didn't experience before. This, was something new to him. He was shocked! It looked different. He was thrilled.

"Try to think how it would feel for us birds! Can you guess how much time and hard work it takes for us to feel so free?"

Gerry, stunned, then said “I never understood! And, for sure I feel more lucky with this, I never knew this way. Let me think about it."

Then Gerry went over to the acacia trees, observing their height, admiring the strong and the long stretches he can get to! After that Gerry started to look at himself, observing his strengths! And the unique advantages he had compared to all of the other animals and birds! The Giraffe felt thankful!

After that Gerry got back to Finley, to speak to him again.

"Finley, I understood! What you've said opened my eyes. I was so focused on what I *couldn't* do, that I forgot to appreciate what I *can* do! This place has it all and I can even get to the very highest heights!” Gerry said with excitement.

“You are absolutely right Gerry! Never forget that you have more than enough. Always keep your eyes open!” Finley exclaimed, feeling pleased to see Gerry's change in perception.

Finley was delighted to have had a good impact on his friend. It was Gerry who changed his perspective and taught Finley some humility and how to better understand a companion in a way of trust and respect!

"Now, tell me, how about a flight above?" asked Finley.

With that, Gerry realized what Finley had meant. He would never fly in the way a bird does. He couldn't sprout wings and soar. But the view... the feeling of freedom… could still be achieved through observation. And who better to experience it with? Gerry made a friend that day.

Finley became Gerry's guide. They would spend hours together. Finley showed Gerry the best places to watch the sunsets, the best clouds to see, teaching him all about the sky! Gerry, in turn, showed Finley the deliciousness of the best acacia leaves and what the world looked like from high up above, how the Giraffe sees the land.

Sometimes, they would meet together and find each other.
And sometimes, each with its different advantages, one would observe from the ground while the other would fly through the air. And then come together, and see things through a new lens!
From that day on, Gerry still looked up at the birds with admiration, but he no longer felt envious. Instead, he admired the land, and the air with appreciation!

He learned that joy could be found not just in chasing impossible dreams, but also in embracing one’s own unique strengths, and the beauty of the world around him. He had discovered that true happiness lies in appreciating the good fortune you do have, making sure your strengths are always ready, and seeing the world together with someone you can relate to and trust!

And so, Gerry the giraffe, instead of trying to fly like the birds, learned to appreciate the incredible gifts he already possessed: his height, his strength, his amazing vision.

He was still Gerry, the giraffe who wished to be different, but was now a friend of the falcon who was as free as the birds he admired!
And he was happy, happier than he’d ever been. He could see everything, from everywhere. And that, he realized, was a kind of flying after all.

And from then on, whenever the other giraffes grumbled that he had to pick up the leaves in hard to reach branches Gerry would always be happy with a chuckle and do as he pleased, sometimes doing it more willingly, sometimes finding out more about himself. And the flock of other giraffes now looked at the clouds and the sky every day.

Sometimes, to their surprise. Even though they can never get up there.

And Gerry and Finley went through every single experience with respect and support and friendship! And they lived in happiness and harmony ever after, admiring their differences but loving the fact they can get closer!
And so they both learned to embrace what they were, side by side, seeing the world together!
The end.
