<title>The Starfish That Wanted to Fly to the Stars</title><body>Barnaby Button, a starfish of rather singular ambition, resided in a bubbly, bright, and generally bonkers coral castle situated smack-bang in the middle of the Coral Reef of Chuckleberry Cove. Unlike his ten (yes, ten!) siblings who were perfectly content playing hide-and-seek amongst the swaying sea anemones, eating delicious algae snacks, and generally starfish-ing to the very best of their abilities, Barnaby harbored a secret, shimmering dream.

Barnaby yearned to touch the stars.

Now, this, as you can imagine, presented a slight logistical problem. Starfish, you see, aren't exactly known for their aerial prowess. They are, however, excellent at sticking to rocks, waving their little tube feet, and looking vaguely like a five-pointed (or, in Barnaby's case, a ten-pointed!) celestial biscuit. Flying, though? Not so much.

"Ridiculous notion, Barnaby!" his mother, a stern but secretly-soft-hearted starfish named Stella, would often exclaim, her many eyes gleaming with a mixture of fondness and exasperation. "Stars are far away! You'll get completely sun-baked and your arms will shrivel and then where would we be? Besides, have you *seen* the current? You’d get swept away! It’s terribly dangerous up there."

His father, Bartholomew, a gentle starfish who was usually busy polishing his barnacles (a very important starfish hobby, apparently), would simply chuckle, his mouth forming a perfect star shape. "Now, now, Stella," he'd say, gently rubbing one of Barnaby’s ten arms. "A little imagination never hurt anyone. Though, I must agree, the odds are… astronomically stacked against him."

But Barnaby, bless his little starfish heart, was not one to be dissuaded. He spent his days concocting elaborate plans. He'd study the graceful glides of the seagull seagulls (who, despite their silly names, were excellent fliers), measure the impressive leaps of the jumping jackfish (who jumped, quite surprisingly, jack-like), and observe the erratic, yet effective, swirly-whirly movements of the jellyfish (though he quickly decided those were best left un-emulated, unless one enjoyed a stinging sensation).

One day, while observing a particularly plump pelican preparing for takeoff, Barnaby had a brilliant idea. “If I can’t fly *up* there, perhaps,” he mused, twiddling his smallest arm (the one usually used for tickling the tiny seahorses), “I can fly *out* there!"

He raced back to his coral castle, his tube feet working at a frantic pace. "I'll need assistance!" he declared to his siblings, who were currently embroiled in a rather boisterous game of “find the shiny pebble.”

“What now, Barnaby?” grumbled Bethany, his eldest sister, who always wore a tiny, fashionable clam shell as a hat.

"I need you all," Barnaby announced dramatically, “to help me build a… a… *balloon*!”

His siblings looked at each other, then burst into laughter. A starfish balloon? That was the silliest thing they had ever heard!

"But… but… how will we get it up there?” squeaked Barnaby, slightly deflated (a very apt phrase, considering he didn’t actually have any air).

“With air, you silly sausage!” chortled Boris, the cheekiest of the ten. “And how, pray tell, are we, *starfish*, supposed to find *air*?”

Barnaby, however, was undeterred. He knew of a grumpy, but secretly kind, old seahorse who possessed an ancient diving helmet with an extremely large glass dome and a bellows, from a time when it was fashionable to blow bubbles to catch clams (it wasn’t considered kind today, but in times gone by…) He also knew the grumpy seahorse (called Herbert), because every day he delivered algae muffins to him.

“We'll get it from Herbert," Barnaby declared.

And so, despite the initial scepticism and the frequent giggles, Barnaby and his siblings embarked on their balloon-building quest. They collected giant bladderwrack from the bottom of the cove, painstakingly threading it together with shimmering seaweed silk. They gathered the air-filled bubbles released by passing pufferfish (a rather prickly task). And, after a bit of persuasive muffin-bribing, they borrowed Herbert's diving helmet and bellows. It took them weeks, but finally, their creation was ready.

It was a magnificent monstrosity. A gargantuan, wobbly, green and purple seaweed sphere, held together by bladderwrack, and adorned with sparkling seashells. The bottom was weighted with several of Bartholomew's highly polished barnacles. The top featured a makeshift control system (made up of tiny starfish-sized ropes), leading to a sort of starfish-shaped platform where Barnaby planned to stand, heroically, waving at the stars.

The day of the great launch dawned bright and sunny. The entire Chuckleberry Cove gathered to watch. Even Stella and Bartholomew were there, holding each other's arms (their many eyes glistening with a mixture of pride and terror).

“Ready, everyone?” Barnaby shouted from his perch atop the starfish-shaped platform.

His siblings nodded, all ten of them holding tightly onto ropes, ready to give the balloon a mighty shove.

"Blow!" Barnaby yelled, using the bellows borrowed from Herbert, attempting to fill the massive bladderwrack air-containers as quickly as he could.

They all blew, and puffed, and huffed until their cheeks turned purple. The balloon began to inflate, slowly at first, and then with increasing speed. The onlookers gasped. The seagulls squawked. The jumping jackfish, for once, stopped jumping and simply stared.

Finally, with a tremendous POP, the balloon started to float, gently tugging at the ropes that kept it tethered to the ground.

“We did it!” Barnaby yelled with joy.

His siblings cheered, letting go of the ropes one by one. But as Barnaby got higher, he suddenly realized he hadn't thought about *steering* the ridiculous contraption.

“Um… how do I… go… left?!” he shouted nervously.

The crowd looked back in bafflement, because even they had not foreseen this problem!

But before anyone could offer a solution, a rather mischievous wind gusted across the Cove. It scooped up the balloon and whooshed it up, up, up! It spun and twirled and turned Barnaby, with all his tiny control ropes, into an even tinier star-shaped whirl of worry.

The crowd waved farewell to the balloon, then started searching the beach, ready to pick him up. But then they saw what was happening to the other starfish siblings. The ropes of the balloon, in its haste to escape the surface, caught some strong air currents, and the whole balloon started going sideways over the open water towards... the open ocean! The siblings who had remained at the coast were slowly but surely being dragged with him.

Barnaby saw them, struggling to hold on as the bladderwrack began to unravel in the wind and they were lifted higher, until they became mere specks against the vast blue sky. He closed his eyes, he yelled his fears and woes to anyone who cared to hear, and he made peace with the ocean and his fate.

Then… suddenly…

A massive, fluffy, white cloud, drifted into view. And right behind it, a gaggle of friendly dolphins.

The dolphins, upon seeing the flailing starfish, understood the situation immediately. Using their superior navigational skills, they nudged the balloon gently until it bumped up against the cloud. They then used their powerful tails to position it over their destination – the island of Flibbleflap.

Now, the island of Flibbleflap wasn't just any island. It was a floating island, tethered to the ocean floor by a giant, rusty anchor. And on Flibbleflap lived the legendary Luminescent Llama of Loony Lagoon (whose job it was to predict the weather and herd the clouds). The llama (of course, and just like his name would suggest) glowed in the dark.

Barnaby, still a little dizzy, looked at the horizon over Flibbleflap, where he had managed to guide the balloon.

Slowly but surely, Barnaby and his siblings lowered themselves to the ground. Then they saw the llama. They also spotted Herbert, sat underneath a large parasol. They thought nothing more about the situation other than enjoying the island, eating tropical fruit and drinking strange bubble tea (and after his long trip, he decided it was not the time for his daily muffins). The llamas made a lot of delicious cakes.

He stayed there for a while. He made many friends, including the llama, the dolphins and Herbert.

Finally, it was time for the return trip. Once again, Barnaby's family worked together and a brand new, and even sillier balloon was created. It floated, just like the original one had (more reliably this time!), until they were once again back in Chuckleberry Cove. Barnaby knew he could only fulfil his dreams with the help of others, and so, from that day on, every single day, his greatest joy was in his family, the island and his best friends (and also cakes, bubble tea and muffins, of course!).
And though he still looked to the stars, it wasn't for them. It was for remembering all his favourite moments. He knew one day, he may even be a star.
