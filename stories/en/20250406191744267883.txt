<title>The Gingerbread Man's Escape From the Hungry Fox</title>
<body>
Barnaby Buttercrumb, the gingerbread man, was in a pickle. Not a delicious, sweet pickle like the ones Mrs. Higgins baked, but a real, scary, teeth-gnashing kind of pickle. He was freshly baked, smelled of cinnamon and happiness, and he was currently sprinting as fast as his little gumdrop feet could carry him. Chasing after him, with a gleam in his eye and a rumble in his tummy, was Reginald, the naughtiest fox in the whole of Sunny Meadow Woods.

"Run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!" Barnaby shouted, his voice surprisingly loud for a cookie. He puffed out a little cloud of cinnamon-scented breath with each "run." He wasn't exactly designed for long-distance running. He had little twig arms that flailed about uselessly, and his icing eyes wobbled with every hop.

Reginald the fox, however, was built for running. He had sleek, orange fur that shimmered in the sunlight, and his bushy tail swished back and forth with every bound. He was also very, very hungry. He hadn't eaten anything all day, and the smell of gingerbread, wafting through the air, was driving him absolutely bonkers.

"Oh, I will catch you!" Reginald huffed, his tongue lolling out. "You may be made of gingerbread, but you’ll be gone bread, once I sink my teeth into you!" He pictured himself munching on a sweet, crunchy cookie and his mouth watered. He imagined the ginger zing, the delicious dough. The delicious *everything*.

Barnaby zipped past Mrs. Higgins's cottage. Mrs. Higgins, a kind old woman with a cloud of white hair and a penchant for baking, was peering out the window. "Goodness gracious!" she exclaimed, watching Barnaby and Reginald streak across her lawn. "That gingerbread man is running awfully fast! And Reginald looks rather… enthusiastic!" She giggled and clapped her hands. She loved a good chase, especially if it involved a delicious treat she herself had made.

The chase led them through a field of giggling daisies, past a babbling brook where grumpy Mr. Badger was taking a nap, and over a hill where a flock of fluffy sheep bleated in surprise. Barnaby was starting to feel the burn in his little cookie legs. His icing smile was starting to melt a bit.

“Run, run as fast as you can, you can’t catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!" he shouted, his voice a little weaker this time. He was also slightly less in rhythm; perhaps it was the crumbling ankle.

Reginald was gaining on him. He could almost smell the cinnamon even *more*. "Just a little further, little cookie!" Reginald taunted, his tail practically vibrating with excitement. "Then you'll be my delicious dessert!"

Suddenly, Barnaby spotted an opportunity. Ahead of them, perched on a giant, moss-covered boulder, was a wise old owl named Professor Sophocles. Professor Sophocles, known for his vast knowledge (and his tendency to fall asleep mid-sentence), was observing the chase through his enormous, gold-rimmed spectacles.

Barnaby knew he had to do something, and fast. He skidded to a halt near the boulder.

"Professor Sophocles! Help!" he cried, his voice trembling. "Reginald wants to eat me!"

Professor Sophocles blinked slowly, then rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Hmm," he hooted. "A chase, is it? And a… a gingerbread man? Interesting. Now, let me think…" He trailed off, his eyes beginning to close. Professor Sophocles, it seemed, was on the verge of nodding off again.

Reginald, meanwhile, was closing in. "Well, Professor, looks like lunch is served!" he grinned, his fangs glinting in the sun.

Before Reginald could pounce, Barnaby, thinking fast, shouted out the best solution that came to his tiny cookie mind "Reginald, are you really trying to catch *me*?! Even Professor Sophocles is unimpressed at your lack of skills."

Reginald's ears twitched. He had always been a bit sensitive about his catching abilities. He immediately straightened his posture, hoping that Professor Sophocles might find this "chase" a bit interesting and impressive. "Well, well, I'm hardly trying hard at all, sir owl," said the fox trying his best to speak confidently, his voice taking a much different tone. "It's simply a matter of... play."

Professor Sophocles perked up at the sudden volume, he thought he was hearing a quiz. He stretched himself a little, trying to remain as straight as possible and nodded. Reginald, however, saw this as an agreement with the idea that his chasing skills were the best. Reginald thought this over.

Suddenly, he announced, "I have a better idea! Let's turn this into a contest! A gingerbread man versus the most cunning fox! Let the games begin!" He licked his lips, imagining all sorts of challenges that involved eating the Gingerbread man.

Barnaby, relieved that he'd stalled for time, nodded enthusiastically. He needed time to think. "Yes, let's!" he agreed. "But the first challenge has to be… a riddle!" He figured this would give him a fighting chance. After all, he had ears, eyes, and the mental capacities of any old cookie to come up with solutions.

Professor Sophocles, thrilled at the prospect of a riddle, blinked. "A riddle, indeed! Excellent! I love riddles. Very… intellectually stimulating." He looked a little drowsy, but managed to clear his throat.

"Alright," he hooted, with a crack in his voice, "Here's the riddle: I have cities, but no houses, forests, but no trees, and water, but no fish. What am I?"

Reginald paced back and forth, scratching his head. He had never been good at riddles. "Hmm... hmmm..." he mumbled, "Is it... is it… a bowl of stew? No… maybe a… a… a delicious bone?"

Barnaby, with a secret glance towards Mrs. Higgins's recipe book he always tried to secretly see when she was making the cookies, knew the answer instantly. He always enjoyed that little read.

"A map!" Barnaby shouted triumphantly, having given an extra long, deliberate sigh. "The answer is a map!"

Reginald was stunned. "A map?" he wailed. "But… but how did you know?!"

Barnaby puffed out his little cookie chest. "I have a good mind for puzzles!"

Professor Sophocles hooted approvingly. "Indeed! Clever cookie! Next challenge! It must be a race! This time, to the highest peak!"

The peak they mentioned was Windy Whistle Mountain, the tallest mountain in Sunny Meadow Woods. This was a nightmare for the poor Barnaby, and a true delight to the hungry fox.

“On your marks! Get set! GO!” Professor Sophocles boomed, his eyes slightly closed as the sentence had ended.

Reginald bounded ahead, his long legs eating up the ground. Barnaby, waddling clumsily, quickly fell behind, a small cloud of cookie crumbs left on the track.

Reginald looked back at Barnaby, already at the top, imagining the cookie on his plate, smiling even. The moment the chase started, Reginald realized that this was going to be easier than what he anticipated, although Professor Sophocles was very encouraging, hoping to learn something new from this.

As Reginald was making his way towards the top, Barnaby heard a very loud *BEEP*.

Barnaby thought "BEEP! What?!".

"WAKE UP! This is a pre-recorded message. Your oven has been on for too long and it might cause a fire." shouted the oven-timer in a computerized female voice.

The baker, still asleep from baking all day, didn't hear.
"It's a robot!" yelled the gingerbread man with delight!
"Yes, now, hurry!" He thought over a quick idea, and took out a small cookie hammer, and began to whack it with a steady rhythm, and at each hit, it got bigger!
Meanwhile Reginald the fox was approaching.

"That won't do anything." he growled.
"Yes, it will!" announced Barnaby.
Reginald watched carefully. Barnaby the Gingerbread man began, whacking the hill and as if magic, an escape ladder slowly became available for the Gingerbread man to quickly move. Reginald watched, mesmerized, as the gingerbread man quickly zoomed up the ladder.

“This cookie is so smart” thought Professor Sophocles as he slowly followed, feeling like a student in the classroom again. Reginald saw a potential problem with this plan and as fast as he could, attempted to reach the mountain.

Just as the fox, with his mighty jump, the cliff he touched began to wobble like the gelatinous state it was.
“Hurry, hurry!” shouted Professor Sophocles, quickly reaching for the ladder. Barnaby jumped for the win as the whole top half exploded with candy cane, and sprinkles of the baker’s art!

Barnaby cheered! Professor Sophocles smiled.

And Reginald was caught in a trap. “But the cookie didn’t even...I can’t eat you, I can’t...I” shouted the fox!
“Sorry Fox, the challenge isn’t up to you.” and then, the little gingerbread man happily started eating his icing feet!
The end.
