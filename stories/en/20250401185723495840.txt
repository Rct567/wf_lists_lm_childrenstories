<title>The Troll Who Wanted a Friend to Play With</title>
<body>
Deep within the Whispering Woods, where sunlight dappled through leaves like scattered jewels, lived a troll named Grognak. Now, Grognak wasn't like the other trolls. He didn't enjoy stomping on toadstools or scaring away butterflies. Grognak longed for something more – a friend.

One crisp morning, while brushing the moss from his stone-built front door, Grognak sighed a sound like rustling leaves. "Oh, I wish someone would come play," he muttered to a particularly plump bumblebee buzzing nearby.

The bumblebee, unconcerned, zoomed off towards a patch of wildflowers. Grognak, defeated, went inside. The inside of Grognak's home was simple: a pile of soft moss for a bed, a collection of shiny pebbles, and a small table crafted from a smooth, grey boulder. He slumped onto his moss bed.

Suddenly, a timid knock echoed from the door. Grognak's eyes widened. "Who could that be?" he whispered, quickly straightening his slightly crumpled tunic made from leaves. He shuffled to the door and cautiously peeked through a crack.

Standing there, clutching a small, brightly colored mushroom, was a tiny rabbit with wide, innocent eyes.

"Hello," squeaked the rabbit. "My name is Pip. Are you... a troll?"

Grognak, surprised, nodded. "Indeed, I am. And you're a rabbit! Come in, Pip, come in!" He swung the door open with a flourish.

Pip hopped inside, his little nose twitching. He looked around the room, then back at Grognak. "It's… nice," he said, rather hesitantly.

Grognak, eager to please, smiled, revealing surprisingly gentle teeth. "Would you like some water? I have a fresh spring not far from here. And I gathered some delicious berries yesterday."

Pip’s eyes lit up. "Berries! That sounds wonderful! I haven't had any since... since my friend, Hazel, went to find a tastier patch of clover."

"Then come, Pip! Let us feast!" Grognak beamed.

They walked together to the spring, Grognak carrying a large, carved stone bowl. Along the way, they chattered.

"Do you live alone, Mr. Troll?" Pip asked, his voice full of curiosity.

"You may call me Grognak, Pip," he replied kindly. "And yes, I do. It can be a bit… lonely sometimes. But I like collecting pebbles. See this one?" Grognak pointed to a sparkling, quartz pebble tucked inside his pocket.

Pip admired it. "It's very shiny."

At the spring, Grognak carefully filled the stone bowl with clear water. They drank, and then Grognak led Pip to his berry patch, a hidden clearing filled with plump, red berries. They ate their fill, berries staining their noses and paws.

"These are the best berries I've ever tasted!" Pip exclaimed, wiping his mouth with his paw.

Grognak puffed out his chest with pride. "I pick the finest berries in the Whispering Woods!"

They sat together for a long time, the sunlight warming their fur. The air was filled with the sound of buzzing bees and the gentle rustling of leaves.

"Do you ever do… troll things?" Pip ventured, after a while. "Like… smash things?"

Grognak shook his head vehemently. "Absolutely not! I don't understand why some trolls do that. It seems… unkind. I like making things, and admiring the beauty around us." He gestured to a particularly vibrant blue butterfly fluttering nearby.

Pip seemed relieved. "That's good. Because I wouldn't like that. Hazel would have run away if you smashed things."

“I would never want anyone to run away.” Grognak vowed. "Perhaps we could make something? I know how to carve pebbles into animals. Would you like a pebble rabbit?"

Pip’s eyes sparkled. “Oh, yes, please! And maybe a pebble snail for you!”

They returned to Grognak's home. Using a small, sharp piece of flint, Grognak carefully began to carve a pebble rabbit. Pip watched, fascinated, as Grognak meticulously worked, shaping the pebble with skilled, gentle hands.

"What's that smell?" Pip asked suddenly, sniffing the air.

Grognak stopped carving. "Oh, dear! I forgot! I put a stew on to simmer earlier! We should be having lunch any moment now!"

He hurried over to a small fireplace and stirred a large pot bubbling over the fire. The aroma of herbs and vegetables wafted through the room.

"Smells delicious!" Pip remarked.

They sat and ate the stew together, laughing and sharing stories. Grognak carefully avoided any references to smashing things, preferring to focus on the delicious taste of the vegetables. Finally, the pebble rabbit was finished. It was beautiful, with perfectly shaped ears and tiny, gleaming eyes. Grognak presented it to Pip.

"It's... perfect!" Pip cried, hugging the tiny rabbit tightly. "Thank you, Grognak!"

Grognak smiled. "You're very welcome, Pip."

He looked over to Pip and saw that he was staring into space. “Are you okay?” Grognak asked.

“I’m fine, Grognak.” Pip replied, snapping out of it. “Do you like to play games? My friend Hazel would always want to play hide and seek!”

Grognak thought for a moment. He had never played hide and seek before, or really any games at all. "What does one do during hide and seek?" he inquired.

Pip grinned. “Well, you close your eyes and count, and I hide! And then, when you’re done, you find me! We’ll play until we both are happy. You have to find me three times.”

Grognak was overjoyed. "Yes! This sounds fantastic!"

So, Pip ran off to hide while Grognak closed his eyes, counting slowly to twenty. When he opened his eyes, Pip was nowhere to be seen. Grognak, after carefully scanning the room, cautiously went to the door and went outside. He carefully searched behind the large, mushroom plants. Nothing. He looked under some rocks. Nothing. Finally, he heard a tiny giggle.

“I see you!” Pip shouted from behind a large, mossy tree. Grognak was surprised, but he managed a smile. He found Pip, giggling. “I found you, Pip!”

This continued for some time, Pip hiding and Grognak searching, often with a slightly confused expression on his face. Each time he found Pip, he would congratulate him, and they would giggle, full of happiness. They continued for many hours until finally Pip seemed to grow tired.

“Grognak,” he yawned. “It’s getting late. It’s time for me to find some tasty clovers.”

Grognak looked out the door at the setting sun, which was casting long shadows across the forest floor. He hadn't realized how quickly the day had passed. "Already? Oh, dear. It went so fast, my friend," he said, a hint of sadness in his voice.

"I promise, I’ll be back tomorrow, okay?" Pip offered, giving Grognak a reassuring pat with his small paw. "Maybe we can play hide and seek again, and then after we will create things!"

Grognak's face brightened. “Truly? You’ll come back?”

"Of course!" Pip declared, already heading toward the forest, rabbit-style. "Goodbye, Grognak!"

"Goodbye, Pip!" Grognak called after him, his heart filled with a joy he hadn’t felt before. He watched as Pip hopped off into the trees, a tiny white flash disappearing amongst the shadows. He then looked at the pebble rabbit that he made, smiling.

Grognak went back inside his small house, and closed the door, feeling much happier and comfortable. He then placed the small pebble rabbit on his small, round table, before settling down on his bed.

As the stars began to twinkle in the sky, Grognak closed his eyes. For the first time in a long time, he wasn't alone. He wasn't lonely anymore. He knew that tomorrow, his friend, Pip, would return. He smiled a wide smile, and quickly fell asleep, dreaming of sunshine, berries, carved pebbles, and hide and seek in the whispering woods, and, of course, his new friend.
