<title>Rosie and the Rainbow</title><body>
Rosie was a little girl with a mop of bright red hair and a smile that could light up the gloomiest of days. She lived in a cozy little cottage nestled beside a sparkling blue river. Her favourite thing to do was play outside, especially when the sun was shining. And her absolute, most, most favourite thing was rainbows.

Every time it rained, Rosie would run to the window, peering out with hopeful eyes. "Please, please, please, can there be a rainbow?" she would whisper, her nose practically pressed against the glass. Sometimes, her wish would come true, and a beautiful arc of colours would grace the sky, bringing a thrill of joy to her heart.

One day, it rained, a proper downpour that thumped against the roof and sent tiny waterfalls cascading from the eaves. Rosie knew exactly what to do. She grabbed her yellow raincoat, her red wellington boots (which were slightly too big, so she always took extra-careful steps), and her umbrella with the ladybug handle.

Outside, the world was grey and glistening. The river was churning a little faster than usual, but the ducks seemed to be enjoying the extra paddling space. Rosie skipped along the path, the sound of her wellington boots echoing in the damp air. She reached her favourite spot, a small clearing under a giant oak tree. And she waited.

The rain started to slow, then stopped completely. The clouds began to part, and a sliver of sunshine peeked through. Rosie held her breath. And then… there it was! A magnificent rainbow, arching across the sky in all its glory!

"Oh!" Rosie gasped, her eyes wide with wonder. It was a perfect rainbow, a vibrant band of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It was so close, it almost felt as if she could reach out and touch it.

Suddenly, a little voice piped up, "Hello there!"

Rosie jumped, startled. She looked around. There was no one there.

"Down here!"

Rosie peered down. At the base of the rainbow, where it touched the ground (or, at least, appeared to), stood a tiny creature. It was no bigger than her thumb, with shimmering wings like a dragonfly and a coat of… well, it was a miniature rainbow itself! Each stripe of the creature’s coat matched a colour of the rainbow, in the same order.

"Who are you?" Rosie asked, trying not to giggle at the tiny being.

"I am Remi," the creature chirped, "and I'm a Rainbow Sprite! And you," he added with a curious tilt of his head, "are the girl with the magnificent red hair and the extraordinary love for rainbows."

"I… I like rainbows," Rosie admitted, blushing slightly.

"That is most excellent!" Remi exclaimed, clapping his tiny hands. "Because rainbows are very important, you see. They hold all the colours in the world! And sometimes, they need… a little help."

"Help?" Rosie asked, tilting her head in turn.

"Indeed! Sometimes a colour fades, or gets a bit… misplaced. And that's where I come in. And sometimes… sometimes a human friend comes along too, which makes everything much more fun!"

"So what do you need help with?" Rosie asked, her eyes sparkling with interest.

Remi gestured towards the rainbow with a tiny hand. "Look closely, my friend. Do you see it?"

Rosie looked. She studied the colours. "The… the red looks a bit… faded?"

Remi nodded sadly. "Yes. It’s losing its sparkle. If it disappears completely, the world will lose a little bit of its… zest!"

"Zest?" Rosie repeated, puzzled.

"Yes! Like the taste of a delicious strawberry, or the energy of a bouncy ball! Red represents all those things! We need to help it!”

"How?" Rosie asked eagerly.

"Well," Remi explained, flitting about, "red comes from… red things! Like ripe strawberries, rosy apples, and, of course… red roses!"

"I know!" Rosie cried, her eyes lighting up. "My Gran has a whole rose garden! Beautiful, red roses!"

"Perfect!" Remi cheered. "We must collect the magic from these red roses! Come, quickly! Time is of the essence!"

And with that, Remi, still no bigger than her thumb, began to fly towards her Gran’s house, his tiny rainbow coat shimmering in the sunlight. Rosie, her heart pounding with excitement, followed.

They reached Gran's house, and as she suspected, the garden was overflowing with roses, some climbing up arches, others overflowing the beds.

"Woah," Rosie breathed, looking at the profusion of the plants.

Remi landed on a particularly large red rose and began to hum a tiny tune. Suddenly, the petals of the rose began to glow! Little wisps of red light drifted from the rose and floated towards the rainbow. Rosie, meanwhile, collected the tiny pieces of light she found with an empty jar, while Remi continued his work with a smile on his face.

As the light continued to drain, the petals of each rose grew brighter and brighter, giving off the vibrant smell of the fragrant flowers, permeating the air with the unmistakable scent. Rosie helped to capture the floating wisps. They were so much to be seen that even her whole jar did not fill up all the way.

Next, they had to find some apples. Granny's apple tree was famed for its juicy, deep red fruits. Rosie helped collect all she could. When combined with the red from the roses, their effort caused the red of the rainbow to regain its vibrance.

The effort proved successful. The colour red had been restored to its former glory!

Then, the other colours began to complain: orange felt a bit drab, yellow seemed dull, green was losing its luster, and so on. Rosie and Remi continued their adventure. They chased a brilliant orange sunset (which helped restore the orange), gathered yellow sunflower seeds (for yellow), collected emerald leaves from the forest (for green), and finally they looked for a perfect bluebell to collect their azure pigment. Rosie discovered the whole process was both hard work, and lots of fun. She was so focused on their adventure.

But the best was the indigo. They used their knowledge to find some grapes and crushed their colour. The next part was to get violet. For this colour, they went to the forest and collected all the violets, with Remi singing along while the rainbow helped guide them.

After all their efforts, Rosie had learned more about the colours than ever before. She had learned about working hard and appreciating the vibrant shades all around her. She was even offered a piece of the rainbow as a parting gift.

Back at the clearing, under the oak tree, the rainbow now shone with renewed brilliance. All the colours were clear and vibrant. The red, the orange, the yellow, the green, the blue, the indigo, and the violet, all dancing in the sky.

Remi, feeling tired but happy, turned to Rosie. "Thank you, Rosie," he said, his voice full of warmth. "You have helped save the rainbow, and brought zest to the world. You are a true friend!"

"It was fun!" Rosie exclaimed, grinning.

As a parting gift, Remi held out his tiny hand. A single drop of rainbow light shimmered in his palm. He gave it to Rosie. It felt as warm as sunshine. "Keep this," he instructed. "It will remind you of the magic that exists all around you, if you know where to look."

Rosie carefully caught the drop, holding it in the palm of her hand. It felt tingly and tickled. And with a final flutter of his shimmering wings, Remi disappeared.

The rainbow began to fade, the colours softening as the sun began to set. As the last colours vanished, Rosie felt a strange pull, as if something had shifted in the air. The world felt brighter, even though it was getting dark.

Rosie ran back to her cottage, clutching the rainbow drop in her hand. That night, she slept soundly, dreaming of rainbows and tiny rainbow sprites, and of all the vibrant colours in the world. She knew her adventures were only just beginning.

From that day on, Rosie never looked at a rainbow the same way. She knew that they were more than just beautiful arcs of colour. They were a source of magic, a reminder of the zest for life. And, from time to time, she could feel a gentle tingle in her palm, the very same tingle she felt after the rainbow and its vibrant beauty disappeared, just before the sun set and night arose, and a faint shimmering rainbow formed in the center of her dreams.
