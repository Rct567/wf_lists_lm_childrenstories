<title>Visiting a Planet Made of Gummy Bears and Chocolate.</title>
<body>
"Wake up, Lily! Wake up, Tom!" chirped a voice, filled with bubbles.

Lily blinked her eyes open, pushing the covers away. Tom, her younger brother, grumbled from the other bed, "Five more minutes, Dad… er, wait, who are you?"

Standing at the foot of their beds, shimmering in the morning light, was a… well, it was difficult to describe. Parts of it looked like a sparkling bubble, and other parts looked like a collection of rainbows made of air. Its voice, however, was definitely the bubbly type.

"I'm Fizz!" announced Fizz, its bubbly self wobbling slightly. "And I'm here to take you on an adventure!"

"An adventure?" Lily sat up, suddenly wide awake. She loved adventures. "Where to?"

"To Planet Yum!" Fizz boomed, a joyful ripple running through its form. "A planet made entirely of… Gummy Bears and Chocolate!"

Tom shot up, abandoning his grumpy mood in an instant. "Gummy Bears and Chocolate? Seriously?"

"Absolutely!" Fizz winked, which looked like a tiny bubble popping on its… face? (Lily wasn't entirely sure if it *had* a face.) "But, you must follow my rules, okay? No touching the Gummy Bear Mountains until you are with me and the biggest rule is that no more than 2 gummy bears are allowed. Understand? Any breaking of rules will send you straight back to earth!"

Lily and Tom looked at each other, excitement bubbling inside them. "Okay!" they said in unison.

Fizz clapped (or perhaps it shimmer-clapped, it was hard to tell). "Wonderful! Now, come on! Through the shimmering portal!" Fizz gestured towards the corner of their bedroom. A swirling, colourful opening had appeared, looking like a gateway to… well, to a lot of deliciousness, probably.

They hopped out of bed, already buzzing with energy. Tom grabbed his favourite dinosaur toy. Lily, after a quick glance in the mirror, adjusted her glasses. Together, they stepped through the portal.

Whoosh! The air tingled. Then, they landed.

The first thing they saw was a sky of chocolate. Dark, rich, swirling chocolate clouds drifted lazily across the horizon. The ground? Solid, delicious-looking fudge. And everywhere, towering structures shaped like… Gummy Bears! Some were standing, some were running, all made of brilliantly coloured gelatin.

"Wow," breathed Lily, her jaw dropping.

"This is… incredible!" Tom squealed, clutching his dinosaur tighter.

Fizz appeared beside them, looking very pleased. "Welcome to Planet Yum! Before you go anywhere else remember what I have asked of you"

Lily and Tom nodded.

"Alright!" said Fizz. "Over there is the Gummy Bear River! The waters are a refreshing cherry flavour!"

Lily and Tom stared at the river. It was indeed a flowing stream of shimmering red, looking too good to be real. As they went closer they realised that you could actually see a lot of the features of the place and everything was made of Gummy Bears! They saw bridges made out of sour straws and even buildings formed by the biggest gummy bear shapes they could imagine!

"Careful now!" cautioned Fizz, as Lily and Tom gazed towards it. "These Gummy Bears are very special, it's best not to touch the scenery yet."

They continued walking with Fizz when suddenly they were met with the scene they would only dream of. Massive buildings were there and right next to those was the Chocolate Castle and in front of it was a giant gummy bear playground! Lily and Tom could hardly contain their excitement, however, they couldn't do anything till Fizz gave them a word!

“How can we see inside there?” Tom said to Fizz.

Fizz smiled, as he had the answer for that “In order to get there, you have to be properly ready, my little travelers. We’ve only just started, and there’s so much more to explore!” Fizz explained and added "let's take you to the Chocolate Castle!".

The Chocolate Castle was magnificent, a confection of dark, milk, and white chocolate spires and turrets, topped with caramel decorations and candy cane flags. The air smelled heavenly.

"Wow!" gasped Lily.

"Can we go in?" Tom begged, his eyes wide with anticipation.

"Of course!" said Fizz. "But remember the rules. Now, before entering, can you name those to me one more time?"

“We must always listen to you” stated Lily.

“And we should keep the Gummy Bears at a minimum” added Tom.

“Spot on, both of you!" said Fizz. He guided them towards the enormous chocolate doors, which swung open with a creak of rich dark chocolate.

Inside, the castle was a maze of rooms. They moved to the main hall and noticed chocolate tables, walls made of fudge, and fountains of melted chocolate. In the center of it all, was a huge throne made of marshmallow fluff.

"Can we sit on it?" Tom asked, tempted.

"Of course, however there's a rule" said Fizz. "You see this here is where the king or queen of the Yum Planet is seated. In order to sit there you need to make some friends."

They set out to do so and started getting to know everyone they can! They met a grumpy sour gummy bear named Salty, a bubbly lemon drop named Zest and a friendly gingerbread man. It was a great company and all was great when all of a sudden…

"Help!" cried a small voice.

They turned to see a little gumdrop girl trapped in a swirl of swirling dark chocolate.

"She's in trouble!" cried Lily.

"Don't worry!" Fizz declared. "This chocolate can be tricky. Let's see… We'll need some help. Tom, quick, find me a… chocolate ladder!"

Tom looked around frantically. There it was. In the far end, it had a Chocolate ladder leaning against the wall made of milk chocolate. He immediately ran towards the ladder!

Meanwhile, Lily noticed some other dark chocolate that was coming in. They needed to do something else and fast, they needed to remove this dark chocolate. But it was heavy…

“This chocolate’s too thick,” Lily cried. "We'll need something to…"

Suddenly, Zest, the lemon drop, zoomed forward, emitting a sugary stream. "Let me try!" she zapped the chocolate, weakening it and allowing Lily to pull the girl out.

With the Chocolate ladder Tom made it to the top where he saw her and carefully lifted her from there and everyone made sure to get her to safety. They then cheered!

"We saved her!" Tom shouted, delighted.

The gumdrop girl was safe!

Lily grinned. She felt brave and exhilarated. Tom and Lily had used what they could find!

"Thank you," whispered the gumdrop girl. "I'm Gella."

“Nice to meet you!” both Tom and Lily chimed!

"Right," said Fizz. "Now that's done let's start with one last thing"

Suddenly, they were led out to the garden by Fizz.

The garden was a spectacle. Every conceivable kind of candy grew there – lollipop trees with shimmering leaves, peppermint bushes, and strawberry vines. At the center of the garden lay a big, chocolate-fudge tree and at the bottom there were some chocolate bars.

"Here we go, this is where all of the gummy bears are, all the flavours are kept in this special tree." Fizz spoke as the light from above sparkled as it shined upon the chocolate tree and everyone was eager.

Lily and Tom cautiously picked some chocolate bars, carefully following Fizz's instructions.

Suddenly, the ground started to rumble.

"What's happening?" Tom asked nervously.

"I think it's a warning signal. Someone's not been playing the rules correctly!" announced Fizz. "Quick! Back to the portal!"

As they ran back towards the castle, they found out what the disturbance was all about! And just like Fizz has expected, Gummy Bears are everywhere! Someone disobeyed the rules! They quickly went to solve that matter… but a Gummy Bear had sneaked into Tom’s pocket without his knowledge. It was too late as the portal was now open and everything was shutting down.

"Oh, no!" cried Lily. "We're doomed!"

As the world around them began to melt – literally! – Tom’s dinosaur toy slipped, and everything around them started to dissolve.

Suddenly, they found themselves back in their bedroom. The portal had vanished.

"What happened?" Tom asked, his eyes wide with fear.

"We did it! I knew this had to happen at least once!" Lily said. "Everything's fine".

"You have returned. All good? Everything went so fast!" said Fizz.

"We all did great at making friends and everything was good" agreed Tom.

Fizz floated back. "Yes. But next time, keep it cool, right? Especially with the Gummy Bears. It could be quite an adventure for us next time!"

Lily and Tom looked at each other, grinning.

"Definitely!" They were happy to be back home but their memories of Planet Yum – and the taste of chocolate – would stay with them for a long, long time.

"Remember to tell the story to everyone" added Fizz and as they were happy that it was over, they had nothing to do, and went back to playing as usual. But the feeling of chocolate was the only thing that had them in their minds and they thought of revisiting one more time…
