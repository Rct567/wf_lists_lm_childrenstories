<title>The Sweet Little Piglet Who Loved to Play Mud.</title><body>

Barnaby Button was a piglet. He wasn’t just any piglet; oh no! Barnaby Button was a *very* sweet piglet. He had a pink, perfectly round belly, tiny, twinkling eyes, and a curly, happy tail that wagged with such enthusiasm you’d think it might take off like a propeller. But there was one thing Barnaby loved more than anything else in the world. Can you guess?

“Oink!” chirped Barnaby, his little snout twitching. He was looking at a big, bubbling, brown… puddle!

"Barnaby!" called a voice, "Where are you, little one?"

It was Mama Button. She had a soft voice and a warm, comforting presence.

Barnaby squealed with delight and, without a second thought, he ran! Splash! He landed right in the middle of the muddy puddle, sending droplets of muddy water everywhere.

“Oh dear,” chuckled Mama Button, approaching her son. “I thought I heard a very enthusiastic oink. What are you doing in the mud, Barnaby?”

Barnaby giggled, his whole body shaking with happiness. "Playing! It's fun, Mama! Look!" He wiggled, wriggled, and rolled in the mud, completely covered from head to toe.

“It looks… well, it looks like fun, doesn’t it?” Mama Button said, her eyes twinkling. “But aren’t you worried about getting dirty, dear?”

“Dirty?” squeaked Barnaby, stopping his wriggling for a moment. "No, Mama! This mud is the best! It's cool and squishy and… wonderful!" He threw some mud up in the air, watching the little droplets splatter on his snout.

"Alright, alright," Mama Button chuckled. "Just be careful, my sweet piglet. Don’t go too far. And try to stay *mostly* clean, at least until dinnertime, okay?"

“Okay, Mama!” Barnaby squealed happily, and dived back into the mud, splashing and squealing with pure joy.

Later, a little bird named Pip landed on a fence near Barnaby's muddy paradise. Pip was a bluebird, and she had bright, cheerful eyes.

"Hello!" Pip chirped, tilting her head to the side. "What in the world are you doing, little piglet?"

Barnaby, covered head-to-toe in mud, looked up at Pip. "I'm playing in the mud, silly!" he answered. "It’s the best!"

Pip hopped closer. "Mud? Isn't that… dirty?" she asked, wrinkling her little beak.

Barnaby stopped splashing and tilted his head, just like Pip. "Dirty? No! It’s fun! Come on, try it!" He patted the mud invitingly with his muddy trotters.

Pip looked hesitant. “Oh, I don’t think so,” she chirped. "Birds don't really play in mud. We prefer things like, well, twigs and seeds and… clean things.”

“But you’re missing out!” Barnaby protested, picking up a handful of mud and offering it to Pip. "It's soft and cool, and you can wiggle and wriggle!"

Pip shook her head vigorously. “I have a perfectly clean nest! And I like to stay… well… clean.”

“Suit yourself!” Barnaby said with a shrug and, with a joyful squeal, he resumed his splashing. He even tried to make a mud pie, though it looked more like a big, lumpy mud pancake.

Pip watched him for a moment, her little head bobbing. She found the piglet's enthusiasm… puzzling, but also a little bit… charming. She flew off to find her breakfast, muttering to herself, "Mud… truly peculiar."

As the afternoon wore on, more animals came to visit Barnaby's mud puddle. A grumpy badger named Bartholomew stopped by, scowling.

"Good heavens, piglet," he grumbled, peering down at Barnaby, "What do you think you're doing? You're making a terrible mess!"

Barnaby looked up, his face smeared with mud. "Playing in the mud, Bartholomew!" he said cheerfully. "It’s the best!"

Bartholomew shuddered. “It’s filthy! And you’re going to get all kinds of things on you! Germs! Bugs! Everything!”

Barnaby just giggled. “But it’s so much fun! Come on, try it!” He scooped up some mud and offered it to the badger.

Bartholomew took a step back. “Absolutely not! Badgers do *not* play in the mud. We prefer to keep our fur clean and neat.” He turned and huffed away.

Barnaby sighed a little, but then he shook it off and went back to his mud-filled games.

Later, a little squirrel named Hazel scampered down a tree, chattering excitedly.

"Barnaby! Barnaby! Look what I found!" she squeaked, holding up a bright, shiny acorn.

Barnaby looked up, his face still a mask of brown mud. "Oh, hello Hazel! That’s a nice acorn!"

Hazel scampered closer to the puddle. “I found it! I’m going to bury it to store it for the winter. Can you see how clean my hands are? I have to keep it that way!”

"Ooh, bury it!" exclaimed Barnaby, "That sounds… interesting! Do you bury things in the mud?"

Hazel gasped. "Heavens no! Why would I? The mud would ruin it. It needs to be kept dry so it will sprout come spring! Come see!" She scampered off towards a nice patch of drier earth a distance away.

Barnaby eyed his puddle, his own joyful games momentarily interrupted by Hazel's tidy preparations.

He thought about the muddy feel beneath his trotters. He thought about the splash and the squeals, the joyous wriggling and the sheer wonderful feeling of the muck.

He decided the best place for Barnaby Button was indeed, *right here*. With a joyful squeal, he scooped up another big pile of mud and poured it carefully on his little head!

That evening, when the sun was setting and casting long shadows across the farm, Mama Button came back to find Barnaby.

"Barnaby? Barnaby, it's dinnertime!" she called.

Barnaby, practically unrecognizable under the mud, peeked his head above the surface. "Coming, Mama!"

Mama Button sighed, but she was smiling. She knew this would be an undertaking!

When Barnaby emerged from the puddle, Mama Button took one look at him. He was so caked in mud he looked more like a mud statue than a piglet!

“Oh, my sweet boy,” she chuckled, scooping him up. "You are absolutely covered!"

"But I had fun, Mama!" Barnaby squealed, nuzzling against her. "It was the best mud day *ever*!"

"I can see that," she replied. "Now, let’s get you cleaned up, shall we? Then we can have a delicious dinner, and then we can dream about playing in mud tomorrow."

Mama Button gently carried Barnaby to the pig pen where she set up a big barrel of warm water and helped him wash off all the mud. As she carefully scrubbed his pink skin, Barnaby told her all about his day – how he made mud pies, how he played in the puddle all afternoon, and about the interesting visitors who came to see him, and each of their own unique concerns with regards to dirt and tidiness.

Once Barnaby was clean, he looked around at the world with a different kind of joy, but at the core of it, remained the purest feeling of all. A love of playing with mud, for the sake of fun! And once he was clean, warm, and dry, nestled in his cozy bed of straw, Barnaby Button fell asleep. He dreamt of mud puddles and happy splashes, of wiggles and wriggles, and he knew, deep in his heart, that tomorrow would be another wonderful day of mud-filled fun. And though he now was clean, the little piglet never forgot that sometimes, even the sweetest piglet in the whole wide world, loved to play in the mud.
