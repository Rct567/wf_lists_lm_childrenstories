<title>The Mouse Who Became an Astronaut</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a particularly crumb-filled kitchen, lived a mouse named Mortimer. Now, Mortimer wasn’t just any mouse; he was a mouse with BIG dreams. While his siblings spent their days squeaking about cheese rinds and the dangers of the cat (a fluffy terror named Mittens), Mortimer dreamt of the stars.

He would scurry onto the windowsill, peering out at the twinkling lights that dotted the night sky. "One day," he'd whisper to himself, his tiny nose twitching with determination, "I shall journey amongst them!"

The other mice, of course, thought he was utterly bonkers. "Space?" squeaked Matilda, his sister, as she nibbled on a particularly tasty biscuit crumb. "What’s in space, Mortimer? Probably just more emptiness! And definitely no cheese."

Mortimer sighed. "There might be emptiness," he conceded, "But there's also… adventure! And maybe, just maybe, some interstellar cheddar." This, he knew, was a highly persuasive argument.

His fascination with the cosmos wasn't just a passing fancy. Mortimer spent hours in the kitchen, observing the human family who lived there. He was particularly interested in their contraptions, their gadgets, and anything that looked remotely rocket-shaped. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to build a small, but functional, spaceship out of discarded cardboard and bottle caps. It mostly resulted in him covered in sticky glue and disappointment.

One day, the human family brought home a new item: a shiny, silver telescope. Mortimer was ecstatic! This was his opportunity. He watched as the family assembled it, careful to memorise every step. Then, using his remarkable agility (and a great deal of luck), he snuck into the pantry, where the telescope parts were stored overnight.

The next morning, chaos reigned. The family searched frantically for the screws and bolts, mumbling about mischievous gremlins. Mortimer, meanwhile, was hard at work, painstakingly constructing his own, miniature version of the telescope out of thimble and a magnifying glass he had pilfered from the human's glasses case.

His first glimpse through his "mini-scope" was, well, blurry. He could barely make out a fuzzy blob, which he suspected was the moon. But he didn’t give up. He kept adjusting and tinkering, finally managing to sharpen the image. And there it was! The moon, gleaming brightly. He had a view!

This only fueled his desire to become an astronaut even further.

Over the next few weeks, Mortimer’s scientific pursuits increased. He studied diagrams in discarded encyclopedias (always making sure to avoid the sticky jam-covered pages). He learned about planets, constellations, and the importance of oxygen.

His ambition even led him to attempting to communicate with his new-found moon "friend", but unfortunately, the best he could muster was squeaks and chirps of greeting. The Moon remained unresponsive.

One evening, disaster struck. The family decided to throw a particularly elaborate birthday party. The kitchen was filled with balloons, streamers, and most importantly, CAKE! A giant, multi-tiered cake, decorated with colourful icing and tiny, edible space rockets.

Mortimer was, of course, in heaven (or, at least, the kitchen). He was particularly drawn to the edible rockets, each one the perfect size for a tiny mouse. He planned to take one, and pretend to fly to his "moon friend" as his next venture.

He was just about to launch his operation rocket retrieval mission, when a loud CLANG! ripped through the happy birthday music. It was Mittens, the cat, having knocked over a table and crashed onto the cake. Disaster had struck! The cake was demolished, frosting everywhere, and Mittens looked decidedly unhappy.

In the ensuing chaos, Mortimer saw his chance. He was going to make the jump! To space!

Seeing an opportunity (a slightly flattened cake and a distracted cat), Mortimer decided this was his chance. He swiftly located a strategically-placed rocket-shaped biscuit on a side of the cake that wasn't completely flattened, and then darted towards the nearest and biggest rocket he could locate. A perfectly frosted, and absolutely massive cake rocket that, luckily, was still intact. It was perched on a plate, close to a stack of unopened boxes of cereal. This was key to his plan.

He knew a human would need the boxes for food; surely, he could use them for an even more impressive space trip.

Climbing the table wasn’t a problem for the agile mouse. Scaling the gigantic birthday cake was tricky, especially with so many feet scrambling around in panicked circles, but soon, he was near his destination. He quickly used his mini-scope to observe the situation (and assess the risks) before launching his operation cake escape. He was finally ready to begin his mission!

Now came the most difficult part. He gnawed and gnawed, as his little mouse jaws, into the base of the massive frosted rocket. Soon, it was free. It would not be simple, and he knew that a little "helper" was needed to get it moving. His plan was coming together.

Meanwhile, amidst the birthday party chaos, the human family continued their search for the missing telescope parts, unaware that their furry, tiny neighbor was about to embark on the adventure of his dreams.

Mortimer reached the edge of the table. It was time to launch. He pushed, and shoved. He nudged it further… and further! At long last, with a final, mighty heave, the cake rocket rolled off the table. It landed with a satisfying THUD onto a box of breakfast cereal - the kind that promised "Cosmic Crunch" on the front.

"This," Mortimer squeaked triumphantly, before realizing the box had an opening at the top. He squeezed the rocket in to protect his precious payload from landing debris and started to eat the cake and get in the right position. "is... Launch!"

With a final push, and the help of a bit of rolling on a perfectly sized pile of "Cosmic Crunch", the cereal box, complete with the cake rocket and the mouse astronaut inside, tumbled out of the open front door. The impact was relatively soft.

He poked his head from a conveniently located opening. A whole world of possibility lay before him! Outside, he looked up at the twinkling lights. He was on the sidewalk, but he was on his way. He had to adjust the "thrusters" – a few more strategic nibbles, of the cake and its rocket base.

Suddenly, a gust of wind swept down the street, carrying with it a rogue balloon (another space-themed one, in fact!). The balloon, filled with helium and birthday wishes, bumped against the side of his cereal box. The rocket took off.

"Woo-hoo!" squeaked Mortimer, completely amazed.

He began to roll forward at great speed, right onto the road, and right towards the next open place. An abandoned dumpster.

The dumpster, surprisingly, was large enough for an interstellar voyage. He kept eating cake as he looked for any potential dangers.

He steered using his tiny mini-scope, and chewed and worked to avoid crashes. Then he saw it: his friend the moon, growing ever closer.

And so, the mouse who was determined, on his epic quest for space-food, embarked on his journey of dreams.

Mittens the cat, now having escaped her confinement after the cake-cide, found a rather delicious snack in the cereal, now fully strewn, across the pavement. She sniffed at the air and licked her lips, thinking how nice it was. She then proceeded to eat some more cosmic crunch and watch the sunset. But she had an eye, of course, in search of Mortimer.

Where the mini-scope took him no one knew; his travels and adventure were only just starting; no matter where they landed, with cake or without, it would forever be an intergalactic ride. And with the courage of his cake-fueled adventure, it didn't matter what other creatures might watch. For he, Mortimer, was finally, and undeniably, an astronaut.
