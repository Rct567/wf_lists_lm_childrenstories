<title>When Giants Started Being Kind</title>
<body>
"Bartholomew, stop stomping!" cried Lily, her voice barely a squeak above the rhythmic *THUMP, THUMP, THUMP* of the giant’s footsteps.

Bartholomew, a giant with a nose like a large, slightly misshapen carrot and feet the size of small rowing boats, paused. The very ground seemed to sigh with relief. He peered down at Lily, a girl no bigger than his thumb, who stood bravely in the middle of what he'd been using as a path.

"What is it, little one?" boomed Bartholomew, his voice shaking the leaves from the ancient oak trees that towered nearby.

"You’re… you're scaring the squirrels," Lily said, clutching a small, twig-woven basket to her chest. "And the badgers are hiding, and the butterflies have stopped dancing. And…" she hesitated, "it's hard to hear the birds sing."

Bartholomew grumbled. "Well, I didn’t mean to. Just… walking. That’s all I was doing. Walking to the Whispering Waterfall."

"But your walking is… well, it’s a bit loud," Lily offered, trying to sound polite.

Bartholomew scratched his chin, a gesture that nearly uprooted a small bush. "Loud, is it? Hmm. Always been loud, I have. A giant thing, you see. Loud comes with the territory."

"Maybe," Lily suggested, carefully, "maybe there's another way?"

Bartholomew stared at her, his one eye blinking slowly. He’d lived for over three hundred years and never once had anyone suggested he alter the way he walked. “Another way? What way is that, little one?”

Lily, feeling braver now, stepped forward. “Well, perhaps… you could try… tiptoeing?”

Bartholomew's brow furrowed. "Tiptoeing? Me? Tiptoeing? That's… preposterous!" He let out a chuckle that sounded like a landslide.

"Or," Lily continued, undeterred, "you could try walking softly. Like you're trying not to wake a sleeping baby."

Bartholomew stopped laughing. He considered this. A sleeping baby? He wasn't entirely sure what a sleeping baby *was*, but it sounded… gentle.

"Tell you what," he rumbled, "I'll try. But don't go getting your hopes up. I'm still a giant, after all."

He bent down, which caused Lily to have to run backwards a little to keep her footing. "Right," he said, taking a step forward. Instead of the familiar *THUMP*, a softer, almost muffled sound emerged. It was… an attempt.

"Is that better?" he asked, a hint of uncertainty in his voice.

Lily peeped up from behind the little oak. “A little! A lot actually. It's much, much better!”

She beamed, her smile as bright as the wildflowers that bloomed at Bartholomew's enormous feet. "See? You can do it!"

And so, Bartholomew began his tiptoeing, or as close to tiptoeing as a giant could manage. It wasn't easy. His immense feet kept wanting to pound, but he tried. He focused on the sleeping baby, picturing the tiny creature.

The squirrels, after a moment of cautious observation, slowly emerged from their hiding places, their twitching noses twitching with curiosity. The badgers cautiously peeked out from their dens, their striped faces gleaming in the dappled sunlight. And the butterflies, sensing a change in the air, began to dance once more, their wings shimmering in the light.

For days, Bartholomew practiced his gentle steps. Lily, armed with her little basket and a heart full of encouragement, watched him. She pointed out areas where his feet still thumped a little too hard. She taught him the rhythm of the river, the whispering secrets of the wind through the trees, how the rustle of leaves could tell you about the weather.

“Imagine,” Lily said one day, “you’re dancing. But you’re dancing with all of nature. That’s what walking softly is, Bartholomew. A dance.”

Bartholomew pondered this. Dancing? He'd never danced before. The concept seemed absurd. But he also realized that for the first time in centuries, he was actually *seeing* the forest around him. He was noticing the intricate patterns on the bark of the trees, the colours of the tiny flowers, the buzzing of the bees. And he found, surprisingly, that he enjoyed it.

One afternoon, while Bartholomew was perfecting his “leaf-shuffle walk,” as Lily had termed it, a problem arose. From around a bend in the path, a sound was heard, a high-pitched wailing, piercing the peace.

“Oh dear,” sighed Lily, immediately recognizing the sound. “It’s Mrs. Higgins and she’s crying.”

Bartholomew frowned. He had a suspicion Mrs. Higgins’ weeping was a sign something unpleasant had happened, and, well, they never wanted unpleasant things to happen near the Whispering Waterfall. "What's wrong with her, little one?"

“Her cow, Bess, has gone missing," Lily explained, her brow furrowed with concern. “Bess is very old and Mrs. Higgins loves her. If Bess is lost, the crying never stops. It's happened before; it’s sad."

Bartholomew grumbled again. Cows? Missing? “Well, where do they think Bess has gone off to?”

“I don’t know. Perhaps near the river?” Lily pondered, peering along the path towards the churning, loud water. “Or maybe in the Sunken Meadow?”

“Lead the way,” Bartholomew said gruffly. "We will look." His new gentle walk, he realized, was much better than his old, thumping stomp at a time such as this. He could move through the forest, hopefully without alerting Bess to whatever danger might lie ahead.

They hurried along the path, Lily skipping ahead and Bartholomew treading carefully behind her, the wind ruffling his enormous, carrot-shaped nose. The crying grew louder as they approached the river. They peered around the corner to discover a heartbroken Mrs. Higgins, sitting on a rock, sobbing uncontrollably, with nothing but an empty field visible.

"Oh, Bartholomew!" Mrs. Higgins sobbed as she finally saw him, and pointed towards the dark green area nearby. "She must've got lost near the… the... Sunken Meadow."

Lily, glancing in the direction indicated, frowned, knowing how dense it was and how many hiding spots there were in the vast meadow.

"Don't worry," said Bartholomew gently, much to Mrs. Higgins' surprise, he wasn't thumping, like she was used to. "We'll find her."

Bartholomew, despite his size, moved with newfound agility, now avoiding every obstacle and carefully sidestepping plants. They pushed through the dense trees and, finally, entered the Sunken Meadow. It was a place of towering trees and tangled undergrowth, and Lily wasn't used to walking such distances within such a thick canopy, even with Bartholomew's gentle strides.

“Bess!” called Lily, her voice barely a whisper above the buzzing of insects and the rustling of leaves.

They searched for a long time, pushing deeper and deeper into the Sunken Meadow. Bartholomew used his enhanced height to get a broader view of everything, and with all the plants and trees around, it made it easier to scan the forest canopy and its nearby floor.

“Bess!” Lily called again, louder this time, her voice thick with worry. The forest remained silent, save for the wind’s soft sigh.

Finally, as the sun began to dip towards the horizon, casting long, eerie shadows across the meadow, they heard it. A low, mournful moo.

"Over there!" cried Lily, pointing towards a thicket of thorny bushes.

Cautiously, Bartholomew made his way to the area she had indicated, careful not to prick his toes on anything sharp. As they peered through the gaps in the branches, they saw her. Bess. Stuck fast! She was completely entangled in brambles.

Bartholomew surveyed the situation. The only way to free Bess was to carefully pull back the branches without hurting her, or getting too scratched himself. The thorns looked sharp and dangerous.

Bartholomew took a deep breath. "Right," he announced to no one in particular. “This is going to be tricky.” He began to very gently and carefully pull back the brambles. The task was slow and difficult, and the thorns scratched his hands, but he persevered. He kept talking to Bess, in a soft, calming voice, letting her know that he was here to help her.

"There, there, Bess," he said in a deep, reassuring rumble. "Just be patient. We'll have you out in a jiffy."

Lily, watching the entire process, realized how much had changed over these recent days. Once, this task might've seemed impossible to her. Now, because she was standing near Bartholomew, it suddenly seemed manageable and easy. It was a task anyone could do.

After what seemed like a very long time, and with his hands bleeding and his carrot-shaped nose covered in scratches, Bess was finally free. With a happy moo, the cow waddled forward and began to nibble happily on the fresh grass, seemingly unconcerned with all of the troubles that she had encountered throughout the day.

Mrs. Higgins, tears now of relief, rushed forward and embraced Bess, her arms wrapped around her, before bursting out into more tears, though these were, happy ones. She thanked Bartholomew, the giant, over and over, saying, in the most joyous of tones, that without him and Lily, she would not have found her, or helped, Bess at all.

And the two went off home, along the now well-trodden paths, together and happy. The sunset was spectacular that night, the air was cool, and the forest was alive with the sounds of happy critters, who no longer were afraid of their giant protector, Bartholomew. The whispers grew as he went back toward the Whispering Waterfall, still walking very, very gently, knowing that every new step he took was bringing happiness and peace to all of nature. And Lily, back in her own little bed, thought it over before closing her eyes, knowing that even giants, sometimes, have to be a little bit kind.
