<title>Ruby’s First Day at Underwater School</title>
<body>
“Ruby, wake up! It's time!” called Mama Coral, her voice a bubbly, echoing whisper.

Ruby, a tiny, bright-red seahorse with sparkling, black eyes, peeked from under her seaweed bed. “Five more minutes, Mama,” she mumbled, snuggling deeper. Today was her first day at the Kelp Forest Underwater School, and she was… well, she was nervous. Very, very nervous.

Mama Coral swam closer, her frilly edges gently brushing against Ruby's side. “No, sweetie. Today’s a big day! You don’t want to be late, do you? All the little seahorses and the baby sea turtles will be waiting to meet you!”

Ruby sighed dramatically, all her little bubbles escaping her snout in a puff. “But what if they don’t like me?” she fretted. “What if I don’t know how to do any of the lessons? What if the grumpy old sea slug steals my lunch?”

Mama Coral chuckled, a gentle rumbling sound. “Oh, Ruby. You worry too much! Everyone at school is lovely. And I packed an extra-delicious sea-pickle sandwich just in case the sea slug tries anything.” She winked. “Come on now, up you get! Papa Seahorse has the kelp-cart ready.”

Ruby slowly unwound herself from the seaweed. “Okay,” she sighed, then took a deep breath. “Okay, I’m ready.”

Papa Seahorse was waiting outside, his long, elegant snout guiding the kelp-cart. The cart, woven from strong, green kelp strands, was a familiar and comforting sight. Ruby climbed in, and Papa Seahorse started his journey.

“Are you excited, Ruby-roo?” he asked, his voice booming with fatherly cheer.

“A little,” Ruby admitted.

“You'll love it,” Papa Seahorse assured her. “You’ll make lots of friends, learn new things, and have adventures.” He paused. “And if anyone bothers you, you tell them Papa Seahorse will come running, right?”

Ruby giggled, feeling a tiny bit braver. “Right, Papa.”

As they journeyed through the shimmering blue water, they passed schools of flashing fish, graceful sea turtles gliding by, and vibrant coral reefs teeming with life. The Kelp Forest, their destination, began to appear in the distance, a maze of swaying green fronds.

Finally, they arrived at the school. It was a bright, colourful structure made of giant, hollowed-out clamshells and coral blocks, decorated with shimmering sea glass. Excited squeaks and chirps echoed from within.

Papa Seahorse gently guided the kelp-cart to a stop. “Here we are, sweetie! Have a wonderful day.” He gave Ruby a loving squeeze with his snout. “Remember, you are brave, you are clever, and you are loved. Don’t forget that.”

“Okay, Papa,” Ruby said, her voice still a little shaky. She took another deep breath and, with a determined nod, hopped out of the cart.

As she approached the entrance, a little sea turtle with a friendly face poked his head out. “Hello! You must be Ruby! I’m Shelly. Welcome to Underwater School!”

“H-hello,” Ruby stammered, surprised. “It’s nice to meet you, Shelly.”

“Come on in! Everyone’s waiting to say hi!” Shelly chirped, and led Ruby inside.

The school hall was filled with a bustling flurry of activity. There were seahorses, sea turtles, baby dolphins, and even a playful little octopus, all chatting and laughing. Ruby felt a fresh wave of nervousness wash over her.

Shelly must have noticed. “Don’t worry,” she said. “It seems scary at first, but it's great once you get used to it.”

Just then, a wise-looking old starfish with numerous arms approached them. “Welcome, welcome, Ruby! I’m Professor Star, and I’ll be your teacher for the day. We have exciting lessons planned.”

Professor Star winked at Ruby. “First, we will learn about the different types of coral. After that we'll learn about finding the best type of seaweed to eat. Finally we will finish with a lesson on bubble blowing!”

Ruby took a deep breath and managed a small smile. This didn't seem so bad.

The first lesson, "Coral Colors and Structures," began. Professor Star showed the class a magnificent display of various corals, explaining their vibrant colors and intricate structures.

“This,” Professor Star announced, holding up a piece of brain coral, “is named Brain Coral because it looks like a brain, see?” The class oohed and aahed.

“These branching corals are home to many sea creatures," he continued, pointing to a group of slender corals. "They create a safe haven for baby fish, and look at those elkhorn corals! They are large and beautiful, just like the horns on a large beast.”

Ruby found herself captivated. She loved learning about the shapes and colours. She wasn't shy anymore. She started asking questions, and to her surprise, Professor Star praised her inquisitive nature.

The next lesson was about seaweed. The classroom transformed into a seaweed tasting station. The different classes had different types of seaweed which tasted different to the different animals.

“Now, young ones, we have varieties for everyone. From the very slimy stuff, the green kind and the crunchy kelp," Professor Star announced with a booming laugh. "First, a taste test. Each of you have been given the taste of a particular sea weed, lets begin!"

Ruby hesitantly nibbled on a piece of the seaweed in front of her. “Hmmm, I think it's alright" she said, when she had finished. “It is very crunchy and smells a bit like fish, what do you think?”

“That seaweed, Ruby, is a wonderful mix of flavors! Excellent observations!” Professor Star exclaimed.

Throughout the lesson, everyone tasted each seaweed. Even Ruby’s nervous energy began to disappear, replaced by a comfortable curiosity.

Finally, the moment Ruby had been both anticipating and dreading arrived: the bubble-blowing competition.

The school had a massive area set up where the bubble-blowing lesson was to take place. Professor Star brought out a mixture that supposedly helps blow the most colourful and largest bubbles. Everyone gathered excitedly in the giant area as they waited for professor Star to give instructions.

Professor Star demonstrated how to blow perfect bubbles: with a slow, steady exhale. Then, he gave everyone their own bubble-blowing wands.

Ruby struggled at first. Her bubbles were small, wobbly, and broke quickly. The other students around her were creating huge, iridescent spheres. She was starting to feel discouraged again, until Shelly noticed Ruby’s troubles.

“Try not to blow too hard,” Shelly suggested. “Take your time.”

Ruby took a deep breath, and did exactly as Shelly recommended. Slowly, carefully, she blew. A small, round bubble emerged. Then another. Then another, each slightly larger and more stable.

Soon, Ruby’s bubbles were floating all over the arena, reflecting colours of rainbow on the ocean floor. Each one larger and more perfect. She beamed with pride and looked around to see that others were struggling just as much. But as they practiced, slowly the whole room filled with magnificent bubbles of different sizes.

Professor Star swam over to Ruby. “Well done, Ruby! You've shown great patience and perseverance! You are an amazing bubble blower!”

Ruby’s heart swelled with happiness. She couldn’t believe it – she had overcome her fear! And she had even mastered the art of bubble blowing!

As the school day ended, Ruby felt a warmth spread through her. She had made new friends, learned interesting things, and even discovered she was good at something.

Back at the entrance, she found Papa Seahorse waiting, his eyes filled with concern.

“How was your day, Ruby-roo?” he asked.

“It was… amazing!” Ruby exclaimed, bubbling over with stories about her day. “I loved learning about the coral and seaweed and the bubble blowing was so fun!"

“See, I told you,” Papa Seahorse said, beaming with pride. “Everything’s going to be alright, now. Tomorrow, you can bring along more of that bubble solution! I have lots!"

“Are you excited for school tomorrow, Ruby?”

Ruby thought for a moment. The grumpy sea slug didn’t steal her sea-pickle sandwich. She’d learned a lot and had enjoyed the lessons. And Shelly, and the other students, were the best!
"I am. I am really excited," she admitted, grinning broadly. "Can't wait."

As they swam back through the shimmering blue water, Ruby knew that her first day at Underwater School was just the beginning of many exciting adventures to come. She was no longer nervous. She was happy, and full of bubbly anticipation for the day after. She snuggled closer to Papa Seahorse, whispering to him, "See you tomorrow."
