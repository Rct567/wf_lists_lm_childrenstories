<title>Poppy's Party Under the Rainbow</title>
<body>
Poppy Plumtree wasn’t just any ordinary pig. Oh no! Poppy was a pig with a passion for parties, particularly parties involving enormous jelly mountains and sparkly, silly hats. Her snout twitched with excitement just thinking about them. Today was especially important; today was her annual "Party Under the Rainbow," an event known throughout the Whispering Woods for its utter and complete silliness.

Poppy meticulously surveyed her preparations. Her mud puddle, normally a rather pedestrian affair, had been transformed into a sparkling, bubble-filled spa, complete with tiny rubber duckies wearing miniature sunglasses. The sausage roll buffet was in full swing, with rows upon rows of perfectly golden, glistening rolls, guarded (mostly) by Barnaby Badger, who, despite his grumpy exterior, had a soft spot for Poppy and her over-the-top celebrations.

"Barnaby," squeaked Poppy, her voice nearly lost in the whoosh of bubble machines. "Are the jelly mountains holding up?"

Barnaby, his face a mask of intense concentration, adjusted a miniature sugar castle on top of a strawberry-flavoured peak. “They’re… stable, Plumtree. For now. These things tend to… melt. Especially with Gerald Giraffe nibbling at them.”

Gerald Giraffe, with his exceedingly long neck, was indeed currently hovering near the strawberry mountain, attempting to sneak a sneaky lick. He caught Barnaby’s glare and quickly pretended to examine the sky with great interest.

Poppy giggled. Gerald and jelly mountains were a constant source of amusement (and potential sugar-induced disasters). She then clapped her trotters together, a sound that sent a flurry of glitter swirling through the air. “Right! Time to check on the hats!”

The hat station was manned by Penelope Possum, a flamboyant creature with a penchant for feathers and a nose for fashion. She was currently wrestling a rather large, sequined sombrero onto Humphrey Hedgehog, who was desperately trying to wriggle free.

“Penelope, darling!” Poppy called, dodging a stray sequin. "The hats must be… dazzling!"

Penelope winked, a gesture that nearly dislodged her own enormous feather boa. “Dazzling they shall be, Poppy! I’ve even created a special ‘Super-Silly Spectacle’ for the grand prize!” She dramatically revealed a hat so tall it nearly scraped the ceiling. It was a dizzying construction of colourful pom-poms, miniature windmills, and a tiny, singing parrot named Kevin.

Humphrey finally managed to escape the sombrero and promptly rolled himself into a tight ball, hiding from the terrifying hat. Poppy trotted over to comfort him. “Don’t worry, Humphrey! There's a perfectly lovely, miniature Viking helmet with attached beard just waiting for you!”

Humphrey peeked out, a single eye visible. He seemed to consider this offer. Perhaps a Viking helmet was preferable to a sombrero of doom.

The first guests started to arrive. First came Freddie Fox, dashing as ever in a bright orange bow tie and mismatched socks. Then Beatrice Beaver, carefully carrying a giant bucket of bubble mixture. Next, and importantly, waddled Wanda Walrus, whose presence meant that the water slide would remain blissfully, gloriously cold. Finally arrived Clementine Crab, who was, as usual, impeccably dressed (she had a new sparkly shell this week) but, also as usual, complained constantly.

The party kicked off with a grand water slide splash. Wanda diligently maintained the frosty temperature, while Freddie and Beatrice engaged in a furious competition to see who could create the biggest bubble. Gerald, having lost his jelly mountain privilege due to a slightly suspicious incident involving a cherry-flavoured landslide, watched longingly. Barnaby, though grumpy, couldn't help but crack a small smile, the ice water splashing all over him was refreshing.

The highlight of any "Party Under the Rainbow" was always the Great Hat Parade. Guests would model their headwear, vying for Penelope Possum's coveted "Super-Silly Spectacle." The judges, of course, were Poppy and Barnaby (secretly, Barnaby adored a good show.)

Freddie, proudly wearing a top hat with tiny ears, wiggled through the mud, causing a huge bubble burst to pop directly in his face. Beatrice attempted to blow giant bubbles through her spectacles but popped the first two before giving up. Humphrey, still sporting his Viking helmet and beard (it had indeed proved better than the sombrero), cautiously marched on. Gerald, desperate to participate, had cleverly glued a collection of colourful leaves to his head.

And then came Clementine. Clutching a rather drab bucket hat, she began her complaint before she could even take a step. “Honestly, this mud is far too… muddy! And the glitter! It’s simply dreadful, getting everywhere, even in my shell!”

Just as she finished this rant, disaster struck.

Kevin, the parrot perched atop Penelope’s Super-Silly Spectacle, took off.

And he aimed straight for Clementine’s new shell.

The resulting collision was… chaotic. Kevin let out a squawk of surprise. Clementine yelped in outrage. And the Super-Silly Spectacle, top-heavy and unstable, began to tilt. It tumbled forward, scattering pom-poms, windmills, and, yes, more glitter.

The grand prize, the object of everyone's envy (except Humphrey's), began to roll, directly towards the strawberry jelly mountain.

Everyone watched, horrified.

Gerald, seeing his opportunity, lunged towards the crumbling mountain.

Suddenly, the Rainbow – the actual, real-life, colourful arch in the sky that the party was named after – seemed to glow, the light amplifying a moment. The rainbow, so to speak, began to sing… but just as Poppy said: “OH NO!”

…and with an echoing ‘Splurch!’, the Super-Silly Spectacle hit the jelly mountain, creating an explosion of sugary goodness, bright colours, and pure, unadulterated chaos.

Strawberry jelly flew everywhere. Penelope’s flamboyant feather boa became sticky. Freddie was covered head to toe. Even Barnaby’s grumpy exterior had a streak of pink strawberry on his face. Clementine, however, was silent, her shell utterly encased in jelly and, it has to be said, a great deal of glitter.

Gerald was in his glory, wallowing in strawberry jelly.

Poppy watched the spectacle, for a second stunned. But then, the corners of her mouth turned up.

She giggled. “Well… that was even sillier than I expected!”

Everyone looked around, covered in pink jelly and rainbow colours, then looked at each other.

And then, they all started to laugh.

Humphrey, with a newfound joy that he could not hide, shed the viking helmet and began to roll gleefully in the sticky, sugary mess. Freddie, with pink cheeks, starting eating the fallen strawberry parts, along with Gerald. Clementine was laughing hysterically; she loved her new look.

Barnaby, with his usual frown but pink jelly streak, grudgingly agreed it wasn't so bad after all.

Penelope, brushing herself off, declared it “The greatest party of all time.”

Suddenly, and because what is a Rainbow Party without some magical extra stuff, another rainbow appeared in the sky, double the size of the first, its colours more vivid and its brightness somehow making everyone’s already great time all that much better.

And right on cue, it began to… rain marshmallows!

And not just any marshmallows, but fluffy, white, perfectly bite-sized marshmallows that floated down from the sky, sticking to everything, adding a new level of sweetness to the already joyous party. The air filled with a delicious vanilla aroma, the sky shimmering and sparkling like a thousand, delicious stars.

Poppy beamed. The "Party Under the Rainbow" had never been this gloriously silly. As they danced in the rain of marshmallows, a very happy Penelope placed her most perfect creation atop her very sticky shell. As the party wore down and the night slowly turned to evening, Poppy said her goodbyes to her closest and silliest of friends. This time next year she would do it all over again; what an adventure and joy. And for that year, as all the pigs know, they are reminded once more of Poppy Plumtree's special "Party Under the Rainbow."
