<title>Oscar's Unusual Pet Rock Collection</title><body>

Oscar lived in a little blue house with a very big problem: he was utterly, completely, hopelessly, obsessed with rocks. Not just any rocks, mind you. Oscar preferred the unusual kind. The lumpy, the bumpy, the sparkly, the frankly ridiculous rocks.

His collection, lovingly named "The Boulder Bunch" (by him, of course), resided in the garden shed. It wasn't a neat, organised collection, oh no. It was a gloriously chaotic tumble of pebbles, boulders, and everything in between. There was "Gerald," a particularly grumpy-looking granite boulder; "Penelope," a smooth, rosy-pink stone that Oscar swore blushed in the sun; and "Captain Clunk," a rusty, iron-rich rock that always seemed to be trying to escape.

Every morning, Oscar would race out to the shed. He'd give Gerald a stern look (to ensure he wasn't plotting any late-night rock-and-roll adventures), polish Penelope with a soft cloth, and attempt to tether Captain Clunk with a piece of twine (this was a recurring battle Oscar never seemed to win).

One sunny Tuesday, Oscar's mum called him in for tea. "Oscar, dear," she said, stirring a cup of peppermint tea, "have you been to the park lately?"

Oscar, who was currently trying to convince a small, oblong pebble he’d named "Professor Pebble" to perform a balancing act, looked up. "The park? What for, Mum? There are no interesting rocks at the park. Just…normal rocks." He shuddered dramatically.

"Well," his mum said, a twinkle in her eye, "Aunt Mildred is coming to visit, and she's bringing her prize-winning, award-ceremony-attending, exceptionally well-groomed poodle, Princess Fluffington the Third."

Oscar's face fell. Princess Fluffington the Third. He'd heard the horror stories. The constant primping. The designer dog biscuits. The disdainful sniff. The sheer, unbearable fluffiness.

"Must I?" Oscar whined.

"Yes, dear," his mum replied firmly. "And you must be on your best behaviour. Princess Fluffington does *not* appreciate being… well, you know…" She trailed off meaningfully.

Oscar knew. The Boulder Bunch's reputation preceded them. Several perfectly good dog bowls had met untimely ends thanks to an overly enthusiastic game of rock-tossing with Captain Clunk.

That afternoon, disaster struck. Oscar was attempting to fashion a tiny rock hat for "Tiny Tim," a very small, very flat stone, when Princess Fluffington the Third arrived. The poodle, a cloud of white fur and a rhinestone collar, took one look at the shed, let out a high-pitched yip, and promptly fainted.

Oscar, initially alarmed, quickly realised something peculiar: Princess Fluffington was allergic to…rocks! He hadn't even realised that was possible.

While his mum fluttered around the poodle, Oscar cautiously peeked into the shed. The Boulder Bunch, normally a stoic bunch, seemed to be enjoying the spectacle. Gerald, usually grumpy, was practically grinning. Captain Clunk, the escape artist, appeared to be attempting a bow.

Over the next few days, Oscar navigated the tricky situation with surprising skill. He kept The Boulder Bunch safely under wraps and distracted Princess Fluffington with (bland, tasteless, perfectly-acceptable-to-poodles) dog biscuits. He even managed to convince Professor Pebble to perform a balancing act (on a stack of dog biscuit boxes).

One afternoon, whilst tidying his room (at his mother's insistence), Oscar noticed a strange, reddish-brown rock he hadn't seen before. It was quite small, about the size of his thumb, with a peculiar, swirling pattern. He picked it up and examined it closely. It was… beautiful.

He rushed out to the shed, determined to find a suitable name and a place for the new rock in The Boulder Bunch. He gathered the usual suspects, dusted them off, and placed them in a line on a little shelf.

He then carefully held up the new rock. "Right," he announced to the expectant boulders, "Meet…" He paused dramatically. He looked at the rock, and then back at the boulders. Suddenly, inspiration struck. "Meet…Professor Pebble's Best Friend!"

Gerald the granite boulder actually let out a rumble that sounded suspiciously like laughter. Penelope, the pink stone, seemed to glow a little brighter. Captain Clunk, ever the show-off, did a little hop.

But then, a shadow fell over the shed entrance. It was Princess Fluffington the Third, fully recovered, and sniffing suspiciously. Oscar braced himself for the worst.

To his astonishment, instead of a high-pitched yip, the poodle let out a quiet, gentle whine. Then, slowly, tentatively, she took a few steps inside the shed.

Oscar and the Boulder Bunch stared in bewildered silence as Princess Fluffington the Third, with a look of intense concentration, carefully sniffed at…Professor Pebble's Best Friend.

Suddenly, the poodle's tail began to wag. She nudged the rock with her nose. She then did something even more shocking: she whined again, but this time it was a happy whine, and she licked…the rock!

Oscar was utterly speechless.

Princess Fluffington continued to interact with Professor Pebble's Best Friend, nudging it, sniffing it, and giving it the occasional lick. She then proceeded to nose-bump each member of The Boulder Bunch in a surprisingly respectful manner. Even grumpy Gerald seemed to relax.

Oscar’s mum appeared at the shed door. "Oscar," she said, sounding utterly baffled, "Princess Fluffington… she seems to… like the rocks!"

"It seems so, Mum," Oscar replied, still staring at the scene in disbelief.

The following week was a whirlwind. Princess Fluffington the Third, it turned out, was fascinated by rocks. She’d spend hours in the shed with Oscar, sniffing and examining The Boulder Bunch. She even started her own tiny collection, meticulously gathering the smallest, smoothest pebbles she could find.

Oscar, previously concerned about keeping the two parties separate, found himself facilitating their rock-related friendship. He taught Princess Fluffington about different rock types and the fascinating history of the stones in The Boulder Bunch. He even started bringing her (perfectly acceptable to poodles) rock treats - tiny, safe, polished pebbles to chew on.

Eventually, the time came for Princess Fluffington the Third to depart. Oscar, surprisingly, found himself a little sad. He’d grown rather fond of the fluffy, rock-loving poodle.

As she left, she gifted him with a special farewell. She sat beside Gerald, gave him a soft sniff and a gentle lick (something she had developed as her own routine) and winked. Well, as much as a poodle could wink.

Oscar grinned. The Boulder Bunch had made a friend, and a surprisingly good one at that.

From then on, Oscar continued his rock-collecting and his dedication to The Boulder Bunch. They still battled escaping from Captain Clunk’s attempted get-aways, Professor Pebble continued his balancing act (he’d perfected it by now), and Penelope continued to blush whenever Oscar polished her. And whenever he collected a new rock, he knew he now had a very special, very fluffy, rock-loving friend who would adore it, too. Princess Fluffington, wherever she was, would undoubtedly be sniffing, nudging, and licking rocks, happily embracing the joy of unusual rocks in every conceivable location. And Oscar, with his now enhanced shed and The Boulder Bunch, knew that his unusually rocky life was just beginning, and was filled with a special kind of friendship.
