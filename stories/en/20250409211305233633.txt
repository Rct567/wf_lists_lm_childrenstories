<title>The Whale Who Spoke in Riddles with its Friends.</title><body>Once upon a time, far out in the deep blue sea, lived a very special whale named Wally. Wally wasn't like the other whales. Sure, he loved to swim and sing whale songs, but he had a secret: Wally spoke in riddles. Every morning, as the sun peeked over the horizon and painted the water gold, Wally would gather his friends for a riddle game.

His best friend was a playful dolphin named Dee. Dee was quick and loved to leap through the waves, and she always seemed to understand Wally's riddles the quickest. Then there was Sheldon, a slow and steady sea turtle who enjoyed sunbathing on floating logs, and Celeste, a graceful seahorse with a shimmering tail. They were all good friends and loved spending their days together, especially playing Wally’s riddle games.

One sunny morning, with the waves gently rocking, Wally swam over to his friends. "Good morning, my dearest friends!" Wally boomed, his voice echoing across the ocean. "Are you ready for a riddle?"

Dee squeaked excitedly, spinning in circles. "Oh, yes, Wally! I can't wait!"

Sheldon, after a moment of slow, thoughtful blinking, nodded. "Ready when you are, Wally."

Celeste, bobbing gently in the water, twitched her tail, her eyes bright.

Wally smiled, a wide, friendly grin. He loved how eager they all were. “Alright, here it is," he began. "I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?"

Dee immediately started darting back and forth, thinking furiously. Sheldon, meanwhile, slowly rubbed his chin with a flipper. Celeste, in her quiet way, concentrated intensely.

"Hmm," said Sheldon slowly. "It has cities, forests, and water… but no houses, trees, or fish..."

Dee, suddenly, yelped with delight, and splashed the water. "I know! I know!" she shouted. "It's a map!"

Wally's eyes twinkled. "Correct, Dee! You got it! Now, for the next one..."

Wally loved watching his friends work together to figure out his riddles. It made him happy. He always tried to make his riddles tricky but fun.

"I have to be broken before you can use me," Wally began again, after taking a long gulp of water, readying himself for the next riddle. "What am I?"

This time, the silence hung in the air a little longer. Dee frowned, circling Wally. Sheldon closed his eyes for a few moments, appearing to meditate. Celeste swayed in the currents, her delicate fins fluttering.

After a few moments, Sheldon slowly opened his eyes and answered, "Well, Wally... it seems like you might be talking about an egg."

Wally let out a long chuckle, a sound that echoed for miles across the waves. “You are correct again, Sheldon! A clever guess!"

“I will go next," said Celeste, her voice soft but clear. "How many letters are there in the alphabet?"

The others laughed at her unusual riddle but the others, were all excited and ready to guess.

Dee bounced with joy. "I know, I know! There are 26 letters."

“That is right,” said Wally smiling. “Well done, Dee!”

They continued with their games, Wally sharing riddles and his friends delighting in the challenge. One day, a fierce storm rolled in. The wind howled, and the waves crashed violently. Wally's friends, usually so carefree, were now scared and frightened.

"We need to find shelter!" shouted Dee, trying to stay afloat in the raging waters.

"Where can we go?" cried Celeste, clinging to a piece of seaweed.

Sheldon, despite his calm demeanor, looked worried. "The storm is too strong!"

Wally knew he had to help. But how? Then, an idea sparked in his clever mind. "Follow me!" he boomed, his voice trying to pierce the howling wind. "I know of a safe place."

Wally started swimming, but the waves were so big. He looked behind him at his friends. Their faces showed they were having a hard time. Wally swam against the stormy sea, and they swam after him, struggling to keep up. They were all very determined. Wally called out a special, motivational song that he had composed:

“Hold on tight, my dear friends, the waves will guide us, the path has no end. Push against the wind, and reach for the shore, We'll find the quiet, and nothing more."

The wind howled and made the music sound a little unclear, but his friends trusted him completely, and swam on.

After a long and exhausting journey, Wally guided them toward a hidden cove. It was a sheltered area behind some large, rocky cliffs. The storm raged outside, but inside the cove, it was calm and peaceful.

"We did it!" cheered Dee, relieved and tired, spinning gently to dry herself.

"Thank you, Wally," said Sheldon, resting on the sand, "You saved us."

"It was very kind of you to lead us," Celeste whispered, catching her breath, and looking at Wally with sparkling eyes.

As the storm raged for several hours, Wally, to keep their minds busy and to calm his friends, thought he'd make up a brand new riddle, to lighten the mood.

"Alright, my dear friends," he said, his voice warm, "Here's a new riddle. What has an eye, but cannot see?"

This time, even in the face of the raging storm, his friends were engaged and excited for the riddle!

Dee pondered the question, looking around the sheltered cove. Sheldon, rubbing his flipper thoughtfully, looked at Wally's face and the shape of his body. Celeste, watched the storm and the raging waves pass by.

Finally, Dee excitedly yelped. "A needle, Wally! The eye of a needle!"

Wally smiled. "Indeed, Dee. A needle!" He had managed to distract them and help them cope. They stayed together through the storm, supporting each other with Wally's help.

The next day, the storm had passed, and the sun was shining once again. The ocean was calm and bright. They were all in great spirits. The storm’s fury seemed like a distant memory. They had never felt better!

They had learned that day. They had learned the value of friendship and Wally’s bravery! They had learned that they can support each other no matter the situation. From that day on, they continued to play Wally’s riddle games.

Wally and his friends swam with a newfound appreciation for the safety of the cove and for the bond that they shared.

As the sun set, casting a warm glow over the ocean, Wally smiled. He realised how much he valued his friends, the shared experience and the laughter, and the joy the games had given them.

"I have a feeling," Wally said to his friends, his voice filled with happiness, "that tomorrow, we will have another grand riddle session!"

Dee jumped up and down again, as though it were the first time they were going to play. "Yes, please, Wally! I'm ready!"

Sheldon, with a thoughtful gleam in his eyes, said slowly. "As am I, my friend."

Celeste gently bobbed in the water, her tail shimmering. "Me too, Wally."

Wally continued his riddle games. The sea held new stories every day and he continued to use riddles to make his friends better every single day. He knew his friends and understood them well. The best part about his life were his amazing friends. And they loved Wally. The end.
