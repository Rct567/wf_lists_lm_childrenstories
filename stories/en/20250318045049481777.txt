<title>The Three Little Kittens and the Crafty Crow</title><body>
Once upon a time, nestled in a cozy cottage with a thatched roof and windows like bright, welcoming eyes, lived three little kittens. Their names were Pip, Squeak, and Patches. Pip was the bravest, with a streak of white fur on his chest, Squeak was the smallest, and often the most cautious, his tail constantly twitching, and Patches was the cleverest, her coat a beautiful tapestry of black, white, and ginger patches. They belonged to a kind old woman named Agnes, who loved them more than words could say.

Their days were filled with playful adventures. They’d chase butterflies in the sun-drenched garden, bat at dust motes dancing in sunbeams, and curl up in a purring heap on Agnes's lap while she read aloud from her well-worn books. But their favorite time of day was always just before sunset, when Agnes would set out three little saucers of warm milk.

One blustery afternoon, a particularly clever and rather mischievous crow named Corvus observed the kittens from the branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel beside the cottage. Corvus was known throughout the Whispering Woods for his sharp eyes, his clever plans, and his fondness for shiny things. He had already pilfered buttons from Mrs. Higgins's knitting basket and a sparkly earring from Farmer Giles's scarecrow.

As the sun began to dip towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, Agnes placed the three saucers of milk outside the back door. Pip, Squeak, and Patches, already anticipating their treat, came bounding out, their tiny pink tongues eager.

Corvus, perched in his usual spot, let out a loud "Caw!" that echoed through the garden. The kittens, startled, looked up at him.

“Greetings, little fluffballs!” Corvus announced, his voice surprisingly smooth for a crow. “I’ve noticed you enjoy your milky treat. Tell me, is it always the same? Perhaps a little… boring?”

Pip, being the boldest, puffed out his chest. “Boring? Our milk is delicious! Agnes makes it special.”

“Indeed,” Corvus replied, with a glint in his beady eyes. “But wouldn’t it be more exciting if…well, let’s just say there was a surprise involved?”

Squeak shivered. "What kind of surprise?" he whispered, clutching at Patches's fluffy tail.

“I happen to know of a magnificent prize, hidden deep within the Whispering Woods," Corvus continued, flapping his wings theatrically. "A treasure that would make your milk even sweeter. All you have to do is solve my riddles."

Patches, intrigued, tilted her head. "Riddles? What riddles?"

"I will ask you three riddles," Corvus declared. "Answer them correctly, and I will reveal the secret location of the prize. Fail, and you will be left to sip your… ordinary milk.”

Pip, Squeak, and Patches looked at each other, their small hearts thumping. The allure of a “magnificent prize” was too tempting to resist. Even Squeak felt a little bit brave, spurred on by his siblings.

“Alright,” Pip agreed, after a moment of considering. “We accept your challenge.”

Corvus, delighted, puffed out his chest even further. “Excellent! Now, listen closely. Here’s your first riddle:”

"I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?"

The three kittens huddled together, their little heads close. They thought and thought, pacing back and forth on the grass. After a few moments, Patches, the cleverest, suddenly stopped and meowed excitedly.

“It's a map!” she declared.

Corvus, momentarily taken aback by their quick answer, recovered quickly. “Correct! Very good, little Patches. Your first riddle has been solved. But the path to the prize gets more complicated.”

“Now, for the second riddle!” Corvus continued. "I am always hungry; I must always be fed; The finger I lick, will soon turn red. What am I?”

This riddle gave the kittens pause. They looked at each other, and even Pip looked stumped. They wracked their brains, whispering ideas to each other, pawing at the ground in their desperation. Suddenly, Squeak, usually the most cautious of the three, let out a small, shaky meow.

"It’s a fire!" he squeaked. "A fire needs wood to burn, and if you get too close, you get burnt!”

Corvus squawked, surprised. “Astute little Squeak! Indeed, a fire. Two riddles down, one to go. But be warned, the final riddle is the trickiest.” He adjusted his stance on the branch.

He leaned forward. “My final riddle! What has an eye, but cannot see?"

The kittens fell silent again. This time, the riddle seemed utterly impossible. They stared at Corvus, then looked at the oak tree, the setting sun, their own paws… nothing sparked an idea. Minutes ticked by. The shadows grew long.

Pip, his usual bravery starting to fade, slumped. "We can't do it," he mumbled. "We'll never get the prize."

Squeak began to cry a little. "We're going to have to drink ordinary milk!" he whimpered.

Patches, however, refused to give up. She walked over to the oak tree and began to look at it, looking closely at the branches and the knots on its trunk. She looked at the leaves. The last rays of the setting sun hit her in the eyes.

Suddenly, her tail twitched. She looked at Corvus.

“It’s a needle!” she shouted.

Corvus's jaw, or beak, dropped open. He'd expected the kittens to stumble, to be baffled, and to eventually give up. He did not expect them to be this clever. He felt an unfamiliar pang of... respect.

“Correct!” he conceded, his voice now a bit less smug. "You have solved all three riddles. You deserve your prize!”

He then flapped his wings and flew a short distance to the north of the oak tree. He landed in a patch of wildflowers and pushed aside a cluster of daisies. Underneath, he revealed a small, smooth, round, perfectly polished, robin's egg! It was nestled in a bed of soft moss, and glistened softly in the dimming light.

Pip, Squeak, and Patches rushed over, their eyes wide with wonder. It was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.

“What is it?” Pip asked, tentatively.

“It’s a wishing egg,” Corvus explained, though perhaps not as warmly as he had originally intended. “You can each make a wish.”

The kittens looked at each other, bewildered. After their quest, they had forgotten all about wishes.

They each took a moment. Pip, true to his adventurous spirit, wished for endless sunshine and endless adventures. Squeak, after so bravely battling his fear, wished for a brave new friend. And Patches, using her wisdom, wished for Agnes to never be sad.

They held the egg, shared a special little moment, and they each made a wish, which was a true treasure.

They returned to their saucers of milk. After such an exciting afternoon, the warm milk tasted like a feast! They thanked Corvus, although he grumbled something about being more cunning, and they brought the wishing egg inside.

The next day, they awoke to find the cottage filled with a golden glow, just like Pip's wish. A small, fluffy bunny appeared in the garden, hopping playfully alongside them, Squeak's friend, and Agnes, the most surprised of all, received a new box of knitting wools, with every colour she had ever dreamed of.

Corvus, from his perch in the oak tree, watched them with a slightly thoughtful gaze. Perhaps, he realized, helping others, and seeing their happiness, could be just as rewarding as hoarding shiny objects. And maybe, just maybe, tomorrow, he’d try being… helpful, himself.

From that day on, the three little kittens, Pip, Squeak, and Patches, continued their adventures, forever remembering the day they outsmarted the crafty crow, and discovered the greatest treasure of all: the joy of solving riddles, the bond of friendship, the value of courage, and the pure, simple comfort of warm milk.
