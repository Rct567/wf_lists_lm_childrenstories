<title>The Fastest Snail in the Garden</title><body>

In the heart of a lush, green garden, nestled amongst the rose bushes and towering sunflowers, lived a snail named Shelley. Unlike her many snail siblings, cousins, and aunts, Shelley harboured a secret desire: she wanted to be fast. Now, in the world of snails, speed was not generally considered a virtue. Slowness was, after all, the order of the day. Snail society prized leisurely afternoons spent munching on lettuce leaves, thoughtful deliberation about the best resting spots, and the slow, deliberate art of slime trail creation. But Shelley felt different.

From the moment she first unfurled her tiny tentacles, she watched the world with a burning curiosity. She watched the butterflies flit across the flowerbeds, the bees zoom from blossom to blossom, and the ladybugs scuttle along the garden path with remarkable agility. And she longed to experience that freedom, that exhilarating sense of movement.

Her family, of course, did not understand. “Shelley, dear,” her mother would say, her voice a gentle, slow murmur, “There’s no need to rush. The tastiest leaves are always waiting, and the sun always shines.”

Her father would add, his voice equally slow, “Slow and steady wins the race, Shelley. Remember that.”

But Shelley could not shake the feeling. She would spend hours practicing, pushing herself across the garden floor. She would try different methods: tilting her shell, lifting her body slightly off the ground, even experimenting with the type of slime she produced, hoping to create a smoother, faster path. But alas, the result was always the same: slow. Very slow.

The other snails, noticing her efforts, would often snicker. “Look at Shelley trying to speed-crawl!” they would giggle, leaving a trail of mockery in their wake. Shelley would try to ignore them, but their laughter stung like a sharp thistle prick. She felt a deep sense of loneliness.

One particularly bright morning, as the sun was warming the dew-kissed leaves, Shelley decided she'd had enough. She wouldn't give up. She vowed to find a way to achieve her dream. She would become the fastest snail in the garden, no matter the cost.

She started by studying the other creatures. The butterflies, she observed, had wings that caught the wind. The bees buzzed with incredible efficiency, and the ladybugs, well, they just seemed to be born fast! She couldn’t sprout wings or develop a buzz, but she knew she could study their movements, learn from their energy, and apply some of those principles to her own locomotion.

She began by selecting a target. A juicy, plump, green leaf located near the rose bushes, a significant distance from her usual grazing grounds. It was, she calculated, the furthest she had ever attempted to travel.

The challenge was not merely distance; it was the terrain. The path was strewn with obstacles. Pebbles like miniature mountains, towering blades of grass like dense forests, and slick, muddy patches like quicksand. Shelley had to navigate these dangers, or she would get stuck.

Days turned into weeks. Shelley practiced every day. She focused on her posture, keeping her shell steady and level. She tried different ways of stretching her foot, discovering new, more efficient techniques. She carefully planned her route, avoiding the treacherous muddy spots and selecting the path that provided the smoothest surface.

She started by crawling short distances, just a few centimetres at a time. She recorded the time it took her to reach her destinations, diligently noting down her findings. She developed methods of measuring her improvements; she learned that a tiny distance mattered. Slowly but surely, she got faster.

The other snails continued to tease, but Shelley, driven by her unwavering determination, barely noticed. She was focused on her goal. She saw not the ridicule, but the potential, the possibility of achieving what everyone said was impossible.

One sunny afternoon, as she approached her goal, the plump, green leaf, a dramatic event changed the atmosphere of the garden. A heavy rainstorm suddenly appeared from the heavens. Huge raindrops pounded the garden, flooding the paths and transforming the grass into a slippery, muddy maze. The other snails, caught unaware, scrambled for shelter, huddling under the protection of broad leaves.

Shelley, though, saw an opportunity. The rain, she realised, had created a slick, smooth path, a natural race track. Her practice had prepared her for this very moment.

Taking a deep breath, she began to crawl. She maintained her speed and momentum, carefully navigating the flooded path. The other snails, huddled under their makeshift umbrellas, watched in amazement as Shelley moved with astonishing swiftness.

She saw another, even better leaf nearby. One far larger than the other; this was now her goal.

As she approached her goal, she noticed a tiny baby snail struggling against the current, a single tear rolling down its minuscule cheek. The baby snail was very small, younger than her own sibling. Its attempts to make forward progress, were futile in the raging weather. Without a moment’s hesitation, Shelley changed course.

Ignoring her burning muscles and her yearning for the succulent leaf, she slithered toward the helpless baby snail. Pushing against the torrent, she positioned herself so that the smaller snail could find some protection. Shelley created a shelter with her shell, using all of her reserves.

The rain continued to fall, washing over them both, the relentless drumming a steady rhythm in the garden. But slowly, as the storm subsided, the downpour became a gentle drizzle. The rushing water slowed to a trickle. Then the rain stopped altogether.

The sun peeked through the clouds, bathing the garden in a warm, golden light. The other snails emerged from their shelters, shaking off the remaining raindrops. They looked around, and their gaze found Shelley, still protecting the tiny snail, who was nestled safe under her shell.

The snails had not expected Shelley’s sacrifice and selfless behavior.

The baby snail, no longer crying, peered up at Shelley with grateful eyes. Other snails, seeing what Shelley had done, finally understood. Their perspective was changed.

Shelley, though exhausted, smiled. She had not achieved the speed she craved, not on this day. But, she realized she had been moving quickly, albeit with different types of intentions. She did find speed, not necessarily for the purpose of being the fastest, but speed in her actions to ensure the safety of another.

“Shelley,” called her mother, her voice now filled with a warmth Shelley had not noticed before. “You are… extraordinary.”

Her father added, his voice tinged with pride, “Slow and steady doesn’t always win the race, Shelley. Kindness and courage matter most of all.”

The other snails, who had once mocked her, gathered around, showering her with admiration and respect. They’d realised what truly made a snail exceptional wasn't merely a matter of fast speed. The true measurement of any creature, large or small, was the kindness they were able to offer to each other, in difficult circumstances.

And so, Shelley, the fastest snail in the garden, discovered that true speed wasn’t about how quickly she could travel. It was about the speed with which she could choose kindness, compassion, and courage. That day, while she didn’t get to enjoy a single leaf, the sweetest prize wasn’t something she could eat. Instead, the best rewards came from the love and respect from those she would one day cherish.

From that day on, Shelley continued to practice her movement and the other snails continued to make fun of her. Though now, they would make sure to look for shelter first, lest the rain catches them unprepared once again. However, more importantly, whenever they required help, it was Shelley who arrived first; no matter how quick the journey, she would come without hesitation. And every year, they would host an annual celebration in honour of the brave, selfless snail, the snail who proved that true speed was not just a matter of pace.
