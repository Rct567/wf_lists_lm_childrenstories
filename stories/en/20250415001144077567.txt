<title>The Funny Comedian always cracking up every one.</title>
<body>
Barnaby Button, a boy with a giggle like tinkling bells and a nose that twitched when he was about to say something funny, was, without a doubt, the silliest person in the whole of Sunny Meadow. But silliest in the best possible way! He wasn’t silly in a clumsy, trip-over-your-own-feet way. Oh no, Barnaby was silly in an inventive, joke-telling, make-everyone-around-him-giggle way.

Barnaby’s family lived in a wonky little house shaped like a giant teapot. His mum, Mildred, a baker of exceedingly bendy bread, often had to duck under the eaves when she baked because the steam from her oven puffed right through the teapot’s spout. His dad, Reginald, a collector of extraordinary buttons (which, of course, went perfectly with the name "Button"), kept a collection of the world’s silliest buttons in the teapot’s handle. They jiggled and jangled, sometimes even seemed to wink, a constant source of amusement.

Barnaby's best friend, a squirrel named Nutsy, lived in a giant oak tree right beside the teapot house. Nutsy, unlike other squirrels, was terrified of nuts. Barnaby found this utterly hilarious, especially since Nutsy’s name was, well, Nutsy.

One sunny morning, as the smell of Mildred’s bendy bread filled the air, Barnaby bounced out of bed, his ginger hair sticking up in all directions, and began his day with his favourite activity: telling jokes.

He skipped out of the teapot house and found Nutsy perched on the oak tree. "Knock, knock," Barnaby announced, his nose twitching.

Nutsy, still wary of anything that resembled a nut, trembled a little. "Who's there?"

"Lettuce."

"Lettuce who?"

"Lettuce in! It's freezing out here!" Barnaby yelled, bursting into laughter, a sound like a thousand tiny chimes.

Nutsy, despite his nut-related anxieties, couldn't help but giggle. "Oh, Barnaby, you're so silly!"

For Barnaby, telling jokes was as natural as breathing. He’d spent his whole life studying the art of the funny, gathering jokes like a butterfly collector gathers colourful wings. His jokes were not always sophisticated, mind you. They often involved silly sounds, absurd scenarios, and a generous helping of the absurd.

That day, Barnaby decided to put on a special show. He wanted to cheer up Mrs. Higgins, the grumpy owner of the Sunny Meadow Sweet Shop, because he had noticed that she hadn't cracked a smile in weeks. Mrs. Higgins’ frown was as famous in Sunny Meadow as Mildred's bendy bread.

Barnaby spent the morning preparing. He crafted a costume out of his dad's funniest buttons (a sparkly silver one for a monocle, a squishy rubber one for a nose), painted his face in bright colours (one eye a sunny yellow, the other a playful blue), and practiced his jokes until his cheeks ached.

He set up a little stage outside the Sunny Meadow Sweet Shop. It was made from a crate overturned and decorated with more funny buttons from his dad’s collection. Nutsy, of course, was right there, his little paws nervously clenching and unclenching (afraid, perhaps, of becoming the subject of a joke that mentioned nuts).

Soon, a crowd began to gather. Children, drawn by the colourful stage and Barnaby's infectious energy, clustered around. Even Old Man Fitzwilliam, known for his aversion to anything resembling fun, leaned on his cane, a slight flicker of interest in his eye.

Barnaby, with a deep breath (and a slight wobble of his knees), began his performance. He winked with his sunny yellow eye.

"Knock, knock," he said.

A little girl in pigtails shouted, "Who's there?"

"Lettuce."

"Lettuce who?"

"Lettuce in, it's cold out here!" Barnaby bellowed, clapping his hands. The children giggled.

He went on to tell more jokes. He told the one about the carrot who was always seeing a magician, and the joke about the mischievous pickle, and the one about the dog who chased his tail and eventually went round in circles, leading everyone into fits of laughter. His voice rose and fell like a merry-go-round, filled with the joy of making others happy.

Suddenly, the door of the sweet shop creaked open. There stood Mrs. Higgins. Her frown, as expected, was firmly in place.

Barnaby, undeterred, took a deep breath and, remembering his mission, prepared to deploy his most powerful joke: The one about the potato and the detective.

"Knock, knock," he started.

Mrs. Higgins sighed loudly. The children hushed.

"Who's there?" she grumbled, clearly unimpressed.

"Potato."

"Potato who?"

Barnaby, with a flourish and a flourish with a button in his hand, completed the joke. “Potato you want to solve a mystery?”

Then something unexpected happened.

A tiny, barely there, hint of a smile flickered on Mrs. Higgins' face. She chuckled, a soft sound, like a gentle summer breeze rustling through leaves.

Barnaby couldn’t believe it! His eyes went wide. Mrs. Higgins, the grumpiest person in Sunny Meadow, was actually smiling!

He followed up with more jokes. This time, a full-blown laugh escaped Mrs. Higgins. It started small, then grew, shaking her shoulders.

Finally, the unthinkable occurred. Mrs. Higgins, overcome with amusement, began to laugh, proper, from deep in her belly. Her eyes, previously stern, were now sparkling with mirth. Tears of laughter trickled down her cheeks.

The crowd erupted in cheers. Barnaby bowed low, his button-monocle slipping down his nose. Nutsy did a little hop of joy, forgetting for a moment his fear of nuts.

Mrs. Higgins, still chuckling, said, “Young man, you’ve made my day.”

She walked into the sweet shop, disappearing for a moment. She reemerged, holding a paper cone overflowing with lollipops, licorice, and, of all things, a single, perfectly round…peanut brittle.

"Here you go," she said to Barnaby, handing him the treats. "For the funniest comedian in Sunny Meadow."

Barnaby, clutching the cone, beamed. His nose twitched with delight.

That day, Barnaby’s show became the talk of the town. The legend of the boy who made Mrs. Higgins laugh grew and grew. Every day after that, he continued to perform outside the Sunny Meadow Sweet Shop, bringing laughter and joy to everyone in Sunny Meadow, young and old. Even Nutsy, although still nervous about nuts, eventually admitted that the fun was well worth the slight discomfort.

Barnaby never stopped telling jokes, making the world a sillier and happier place, one giggle at a time. His act, though ever-changing, would always, eventually crack up everyone in Sunny Meadow. Barnaby and Nutsy, sometimes even, would start giggling so hard, they were left sprawled, laughing, on the sunny grass. Because laughter, Barnaby had learned, was the sweetest thing in the world, sweeter even than Mrs. Higgins’ peanut brittle, which he still secretly gave to Nutsy, well away from the giant oak tree! And that, thought Barnaby Button, as he polished his button-monocle one sunny afternoon, was the best joke of all.
