<title>The Dragon That Couldn't Breathe Fire</title>
<body>
"Oof!" sighed Sparky, landing with a clumsy thud on a pile of soft moss. "This flying thing is harder than it looks."

A small, green dragon, Lily, with a twinkle in her eye, hopped over. "Are you alright, Sparky? You look like you wrestled a grumpy badger."

Sparky groaned. "I'm fine, Lily. Just…frustrated. Dragons are supposed to be good at flying! And breathing fire!"

Lily giggled. "Well, you're still learning. We all are! And I haven’t seen you trying to breathe fire all morning."

"That’s because… well, because I can't," Sparky mumbled, shuffling his tiny claws in the moss.

Lily’s smile faded slightly. "You can’t? But…but you’re a dragon!"

Sparky flopped onto his side, his emerald scales shimmering in the sunlight. "I know! It’s the worst! Every other dragon in the Dragon Valley can breathe fire. Even little Dotty, and she’s only hatched last week."

"Dotty? The one who can barely waddle?" Lily asked, her brow furrowed with concern.

Sparky nodded miserably. “Yep. She puffs little sparklers. I… I just cough. Or, sometimes, I just hiccup.”

"Hiccup?" Lily’s eyes widened. “Oh dear!”

“It’s embarrassing! Whenever the elders have a big celebration, and all the dragons gather to light the giant bonfire with their fire, I have to sit at the back. I’m the laughingstock!”

Lily sat beside him. “I'm sure they're not laughing at you, Sparky. Dragon elders are always understanding. And anyway, you’re good at other things. Like… like playing hide-and-seek!”

"That's true," Sparky admitted, his mood perking up slightly. "I am the best at hide-and-seek. No one can find me."

"Exactly! And you're also very kind," Lily added, nudging him playfully. "And you have the shiniest scales in the whole valley!"

Sparky puffed out his chest, attempting to regain some dignity. "Well, yes, my scales *are* rather magnificent."

"But the fire..." Lily sighed. "Maybe we can figure out why. What does it feel like when you try to breathe fire?"

Sparky closed his eyes, concentrating. "It starts in my tummy. A warm tingle, like… like when I eat too many sun-ripe berries. Then it climbs up, right to my throat. And then… *cough*… or… *hic*…”

"Hmm," Lily mused, tapping a claw against her chin. "Maybe something is blocking the fire? Have you been eating anything unusual?"

"Just the usual dragon grub," Sparky replied, listing off the ingredients. "Roasted mountain goats, grubs from the underground mushroom farms, river fish…"

"Mountain goats and grubs!" Lily exclaimed. "Those are sometimes hard on dragon’s bellies. Maybe they are causing a problem!"

Sparky’s ears drooped again. "Do you think that's it? But I love mountain goats."

"We can test it," Lily said brightly. "Tomorrow, we can have a day of easy, light food. Just some berries and… maybe some juicy river weeds?"

Sparky looked dubious. "River weeds? Are you sure?"

"Trust me," Lily winked. "It will be an adventure! And maybe... just maybe... we'll unlock your fire breathing ability."

The next day, they met by the whispering waterfall. Sparky looked nervous. He had indeed skipped the roasted goats for lunch. He had only eaten juicy berries and a few strands of Lily's recommended river weeds, that tasted like soggy seaweed.

"Okay, Sparky," Lily said encouragingly. "Try now. Concentrate on that warm feeling in your tummy. Remember that feeling."

Sparky took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and tried. "Mmm… *cough*… nope."

He opened his eyes, his face crestfallen.

"Don't give up," Lily encouraged him. "Let’s try again. This time, imagine the fire. Imagine it like a warm, golden sun. Think of its power, it's warmth… and now... breathe!"

Sparky focused all his energy. He imagined the sun, its rays, its burning core. He felt the warm tingle, traveling. *Cough*…

Then something unusual happened.

A tiny puff of purple smoke drifted from his nostrils.

“Did you see that?!” Lily squealed with delight. "A tiny, purple puff! Wonderful!"

Sparky's eyes widened. "Purple! It’s not supposed to be purple!"

"Well, it's a start!" Lily replied enthusiastically. "We are making progress."

"But… but the other dragons’ fire is red and orange!" Sparky moaned.

"Don’t worry about the color," Lily said reassuringly. "We’ll figure it out. Let's try again, but this time... breathe the colour you want. What's your favourite colour?"

Sparky considered. "Hmm… blue! The colour of the sky when there aren't any clouds."

So they tried again. This time, he focused on the color blue, imagined the clear, sunny sky, and then…*hic*…

"That was a bigger puff!" Lily exclaimed. "It's still purple, but bigger!"

They spent the whole day experimenting. Sparky practiced imagining different colours and trying to expel them. With each attempt, the puffs grew bigger, changing colours in unpredictable ways. He managed tiny clouds of emerald green, flickering streaks of orange, and even a single tiny spark of gold. He got better at breathing different lengths of puffs and trying to keep them as steady lines.

That evening, as the sun set, casting long shadows across the valley, Sparky sat on a rock, feeling tired but also strangely happy.

"I still don't understand why the fire doesn't work properly," he confessed. "But I feel better than I did before."

Lily smiled. "Me too. We might not be good at controlling the colour yet, but you *can* breathe! That's already an amazing achievement! It seems the tummy full of tasty mountain goats was a bit too much."

They heard footsteps nearby. It was old Grizelda, a wise, ancient dragon who had seen a lot of seasons. She had heard them experimenting.

"Well, well, Sparky," Grizelda chuckled, her voice like rumbling stones. "What's all this talk of fire-breathing?"

Sparky, feeling embarrassed, began to stammer out his story, explaining how he could only produce puffs of different colours.

Grizelda listened patiently. When he had finished, she stroked her long, grey beard. "Ah," she said with a twinkle in her eye. "It sounds like you're not just a fire-breather, young Sparky. You're a colour-bender!"

"A…colour-bender?" Sparky repeated, confused.

"Indeed! Not every dragon can control the colors of their flames. Many dragons are gifted with a specific hue: Red, Orange, Yellow." Grizelda explained, "But a colour-bender? Now that is quite special! Very rare."

She explained that the mountain goats and grubs had very little to do with it. All dragons took a bit of time to master their magic, especially dragons of a rare gift. And it just so happened that Sparky had the rarer gift.

Sparky’s jaw dropped. “But… but that means I'm… I’m *special*?"

Grizelda laughed, a deep, rumbling sound. "Very! You can paint the sky with your fire! Imagine the possibilities!"

Lily beamed at him. “That’s brilliant Sparky! Instead of a boring, regular fire, you can create spectacular rainbows, or shimmering skies full of magical hues. Imagine a blue fire!"

Sparky looked at Lily. It’s true, he thought. Being able to produce regular orange or red fire would still be boring for him. A simple ember that simply burned things would do just fine. The way his breath shifted was magical, like the clouds in the sky above.

Sparky jumped up, his eyes sparkling. "Wow! So, I don’t have to be the same as everyone else?"

Grizelda winked. "Never. Now, let's see if we can practice and perhaps, get a bigger burst of these puffs..."

And so, Sparky and Lily, guided by wise Grizelda, spent weeks perfecting Sparky's colourful fire-breathing. He practiced focusing on different colors, creating swirls, patterns, and even tiny dragons made of flame! The whole dragon valley was in awe.

During the next grand celebration, instead of hiding at the back, Sparky stood proudly, and with a mighty puff, he sent a beautiful display of blue, green, and gold spirals swirling across the night sky. The other dragons cheered and whistled with delight, while Dotty and his other peers, gazed at him with awe.

From then on, Sparky became known as Sparky the Magnificent, the Dragon of the Sky, the artist whose flames painted the most beautiful displays the valley had ever seen. And though his friends still loved him and celebrated him, Lily thought he was just as fantastic with hiccups as before, still managing to find a place of joy even in failure.
