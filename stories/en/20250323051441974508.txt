<title>The Penguin Who Didn’t Want to Swim</title><body>Percy the penguin was, well, peculiar. He lived in a colony of thousands upon thousands of other penguins, all on a giant, icy sheet floating in the cold, cold sea. Every other penguin in the colony loved to swim. They would waddle to the edge of the ice, take a deep breath, and *whoosh!* Dive into the water, disappearing beneath the waves in search of yummy fish.

But Percy? Percy did *not* want to swim.

Not even a little bit.

He would stand on the edge of the ice, watching the other penguins with a worried look in his little black eyes. He’d shiver, even when the other penguins seemed perfectly comfortable in the freezing water. He’d hug himself tight with his flippers, murmuring, “Brrr… Too cold. Too wet. No, thank you!”

His parents, Penelope and Peter, were very concerned. They loved Percy very much, of course, but they worried about his well-being. "Percy," Penelope would say gently, "You need to learn to swim. How will you catch fish? How will you keep yourself safe from leopard seals and orcas?"

Peter would add, "All the other penguins swim, Percy! It's what we do!" He would puff out his chest, demonstrating how he gracefully sliced through the water.

But Percy would just shake his head, his little black cap of feathers bouncing. "It’s too… watery!" he'd insist. "And the water is… icy! And I… I don’t like the sound it makes when you jump in!” He was convinced the sound was the prelude to terrible dangers.

The other penguin chicks would try to coax him. "Come on, Percy! It's fun!" they'd chirp. "You can splash! You can chase the fish!" But Percy would just huddle with them at the water's edge, the furthest from the splashing, shivering ever so slightly.

The grown-up penguins in the colony would occasionally nudge him towards the water. They would gently push him. Percy would manage to squeak and then slide and splash into the water. Each time, Percy would quickly flap his wings, manage to make his way back to the surface, then clamber out as quickly as possible, shivering uncontrollably, before hurrying back to dry land. The others would offer gentle but persistent prodding, and Percy would sometimes comply just to be left alone. But no matter how often they tried, he never seemed to learn to swim. He would run from the water, then turn around, looking forlorn, and he'd run away to join a small group of penguins who were also too timid or cautious to plunge into the frigid ocean.

One day, a particularly boisterous storm swept across the ice. The wind howled and the snow fell in thick, blinding sheets. The other penguins huddled together for warmth, but the strong wind made it very difficult for them. The icy sheet began to crack. A massive fissure ripped open near where Percy and his parents were huddled.

Penelope and Peter looked at each other with concern. They knew what this meant. They were trapped. They were going to have to find a way to reach another icy sheet or risk becoming isolated on the small raft they were all trapped on. They’d have to swim for their lives!

"Percy, we need to swim to safety!" Penelope cried above the wind. "There's a piece of ice, not far from here!"

Peter quickly added, "We must swim there and meet the others! Quickly, now!"

Percy froze. His heart thumped against his chest. He knew the sea was now rough, icy, and dangerous. The wind created enormous waves. "No, no," he mumbled, burying his face in his flippers. "I… I can’t."

Penelope and Peter exchanged worried glances. They couldn't leave him. "Percy," Peter said, his voice firm despite the swirling winds, "You *must* try. This is life or death!"

Penelope reached down and gave him a gentle shove. "Come on, sweetie! Just a few flaps! Think of the fish we'll have for dinner! This will be much safer if we stick together!"

He hesitantly looked at the churning water. He saw the huge, choppy waves and he began to panic. The sounds were terrifying. But he knew they needed to get to that sheet of ice and be with the colony.

Percy took a deep, shaky breath. He closed his eyes. This was a nightmare, an absolute nightmare. He remembered what his parents had always told him about leopard seals and orcas, how dangerous they were, how fast they were. And this, of course, meant the sounds he now heard must be signals, telling these terrible creatures that there was fresh penguin on the menu today.

He focused.

He then took one giant leap, and plunged in!

The icy water hit him with a shock. He gasped. It was as cold as he had feared. The noise was overwhelming, the cold searing his feathers and sending goosebumps over him.

"Flap, flap!" he told himself, remembering the technique he’d seen all his life. He flapped his flippers, and to his surprise, he began to move forward, struggling against the current.

“Keep flapping!” shouted Peter, just a few meters away.

He then had to struggle to ignore the water and to focus on his own survival. He pushed on and remembered the sounds of danger he expected. He was sure the danger was nearby, so he worked at an accelerated pace. He must out-swim the potential threat!

He took another deep breath. “Keep flapping, Percy!” Penelope’s voice, though distant, was still there.

The icy water seemed to close in around him, filling his ears and making his eyes water. The noise of the waves sounded worse than ever. But then he remembered the dangers he would meet. He struggled even more, sure the creatures were close now!

He pushed harder, using all the strength he had. He pictured the safety on the other side. He focused. He would do everything. He must focus.

He didn’t look up, though he struggled so intensely. If he didn’t focus, he knew the dangers might meet him!

He could hear his parents flapping, their silhouettes blurry against the swirling snow. He focused on those shapes, remembering what they'd told him all his life, and how they’d urged him to become like everyone else in the colony.

They swam steadily forward, urging him on.

Then, he felt something… different. A current, not so strong! Was he close to another sheet of ice?

Finally, after what felt like forever, he saw it! A dark shape in the distance. Land! Hope flooded through him, a warmth that helped him forget the cold for just a second.

"Almost there, Percy!" Peter yelled, his voice filled with encouragement.

With a final surge of effort, Percy pushed towards it with as much strength as he had, managing a final surge. He could hardly breathe, and every part of him ached.

He bumped into the icy surface of the new ice sheet!

He tumbled forward, finally reaching safety.

With one last effort, he pulled himself onto the ice, weak but safe. Penelope and Peter followed him, exhausted.

They huddled together, shivering and catching their breath. The storm slowly began to subside. Other penguins, who’d been able to swim more confidently and skillfully, began to gather, their calls a chorus of relief. They were safe, now, thanks to their skill, and a great helping hand!

As the sun began to peek through the clouds, warming their icy world, Percy looked at his parents.

"I… I swam," he stammered, still shivering.

Penelope and Peter nuzzled him with their beaks. They were so proud of their little penguin. "Yes, you did, Percy! You were very brave." Penelope beamed.

Peter squeezed him close, saying, “That was amazing! Well done! You never gave up, Percy!”

Percy smiled. He felt a new kind of warmth spread through him, stronger even than the sun. He had faced his fear, and he had survived. He realized he still did not *love* swimming. The sea was still cold and loud. But… he also felt he had done his best. He would be braver.

After the colony was fully regrouped, he actually enjoyed the sounds.

From then on, Percy was still not the first to jump into the water. But he was always ready. He never entirely *loved* it, but he always *did* it. He swam to catch his food, playing with the other penguins, knowing how important it was, but feeling relief on solid land. And, most importantly, he was now comfortable at the water’s edge.

He had overcome his fear and proved to himself that he could do anything, even swim, if he had to, which in the world of the penguins meant all the difference!
And Percy, the penguin who didn't want to swim, learned that sometimes, even when you’re afraid, it’s important to try, because you just might surprise yourself. And the lesson was a lesson he was very happy to have learned.
