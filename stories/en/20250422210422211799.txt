<title>Sammy the Seal Learns to Sing a Song</title><body>
Sammy the seal was, to put it mildly, a bit of a disaster when it came to singing. He lived in a jolly colony of seals on a bright, sunny rock overlooking the sparkling, sapphire sea. All the other seals, from Mama Sal the wise matriarch with the twinkling whiskers to little Pipkin, Sammy's best friend, could sing the most beautiful songs. They sang about the swirling seaweed, the playful porpoises, and the delicious, silvery fish that zipped through the ocean.

Sammy, however, sounded more like a rusty hinge caught in a howling gale. When he tried to join in, his voice would wobble, warble, and sometimes just vanish entirely. The other seals would try not to laugh, but a few muffled giggles often escaped.

"Oh, dear," Mama Sal would say gently, patting Sammy’s flipper. "Perhaps singing isn't your strongest suit, little one."

Pipkin, being the kindest seal in the colony, would always try to cheer him up. "Don't worry, Sammy! You're great at catching fish! And you have the best belly-flop in the whole ocean!"

Sammy appreciated the compliments, but deep down, he really wanted to sing. He longed to join the chorus, to share in the joyous music that filled their days. He felt a tiny, frustrated ache in his little seal heart every time the others started to sing.

One day, feeling particularly disheartened, Sammy wandered away from the rock. He slumped down on a patch of smooth, cool sand, sighing a big, watery sigh. He wished he could be like the other seals. He wished he could sing a song.

Suddenly, he heard a sweet, chirping melody. He looked up and saw a tiny, fluffy puffin perched on a nearby rock. The puffin, whose name was Percy, was singing a cheerful tune about the colourful pebbles on the beach.

Sammy was mesmerised. Percy’s voice was clear and bright, and the song made him feel happy and content. He shuffled closer, his large, brown eyes wide with wonder.

"That’s a lovely song, Percy," Sammy blurted out, forgetting his own worries for a moment.

Percy, startled, puffed out his chest. He hadn't noticed the big, clumsy seal approaching. "Thank you!" he chirped proudly. "I’m writing a whole collection of songs about the seaside. They are, well, they are quite magnificent, wouldn't you agree?"

"Magnificent indeed!" Sammy agreed wholeheartedly. "I wish I could sing like you." He sighed, the familiar feeling of frustration returning.

Percy tilted his head, considering Sammy. He knew seals weren't typically known for their musical talents. "Well," he said thoughtfully, "singing isn’t just about having a beautiful voice. It’s about telling a story, sharing a feeling. And sometimes, it’s about finding your own unique voice."

Sammy looked at him, puzzled. "My own unique voice?"

"Precisely!" Percy hopped closer and continued. "Think about the things you like, the things you see. What makes you happy? What makes you… well… *you*?"

Sammy thought hard. What *did* make him happy? He loved chasing fish with Pipkin. He loved sunbathing on the warm rocks. He loved watching the waves crash against the shore. And he loved… well, he loved eating the crunchy, delicious seaweed that grew on the rocks.

An idea sparked in his mind. He wiggled with excitement. "I know!" he exclaimed. "I love seaweed! Especially the crispy, crunchy kind!"

"There you go!" Percy chirped encouragingly. "Maybe you can sing about the seaweed!"

Sammy, emboldened by Percy's words, took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He tried to imagine the seaweed, its green fronds swaying in the current, its delicious taste on his tongue. He took another breath and let it out, a sort of wobble-y, experimental sound escaped his throat. Then, he tried again.

"Oh, seaweed," he began, his voice a little wobbly at first. "So green and so grand…" He paused, then bravely pushed on. "You tickle my whiskers when I swim near your stand…"

Percy listened attentively, nodding his head in encouragement. Sammy continued, slowly finding his rhythm. He sang about the seaweed's texture, the taste, and even the tiny little snails that sometimes clung to it. His voice was still a bit wobbly and definitely not perfect, but it was *his* voice. It was a voice filled with genuine feeling, a voice bursting with enthusiasm for the seaweed he loved.

When he finished, Sammy waited, holding his breath. He was worried what Percy might think.

Percy, however, was ecstatic. "That was wonderful, Sammy! Absolutely wonderful! You have a fantastic story-telling voice!"

Sammy's flippers started to tingle with a happy thrill. "You think so?" he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

"Indeed I do!" Percy exclaimed. "You have a voice that is entirely and beautifully your own!"

From that day on, Sammy began practicing his seaweed song, but instead of trying to imitate the other seals, he focused on expressing his love for the crunchy green stuff. Percy helped him refine his song, suggesting changes to the rhythm and melody, and encouraging him to add new verses about other things he loved about the sea.

Slowly but surely, Sammy’s confidence grew. He still stumbled a bit, and his voice was still a bit wonky, but it was his own, undeniably Sammy’s.

The next day, he returned to the rock with the other seals. It was a beautiful sunny day, and everyone was singing their usual songs about the swirling seaweed and the playful porpoises. Sammy took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and, with a nervous giggle, he began to sing.

"Oh, seaweed, so green and so grand…" he started, his voice quivering slightly.

The other seals paused in their singing, curious. Even Mama Sal stopped mid-note.

"...You tickle my whiskers when I swim near your stand… So crunchy and tasty, a delectable treat…"

The giggling soon stopped. The other seals realised that this wasn't the rusty-hinge, howling-gale sound they were expecting. This was a song. This was Sammy's song. It was all about seaweed, but more importantly, it was about Sammy.

He finished his song with a flourish, his voice strong and full of passion.

The other seals were silent for a moment. Then, Mama Sal, her eyes sparkling with kindness, began to clap her flippers. Soon, the whole colony was clapping, whooping, and even singing along. They didn’t sing the seaweed song because it was Sammy's.

Even Pipkin sang along, as loud as he could.

Sammy beamed. He had finally found his place in the chorus. He was no longer just the seal who couldn't sing; he was Sammy, the seal who sang about seaweed. He had his own unique voice and a heart full of song, even though that song was all about a tasty meal.
And from then on, Sammy's song became a popular one in the colony and every now and then he would sing about his favourite food. He was so happy to have found a way to express himself, even if he needed the little fluffy bird, Percy, to show him the way. And that, thought Sammy as the sun dipped low over the sea and he began to dream of crunchy, delicious seaweed, was a very good thing indeed. The end.
