<title>Sophia's Song and the Smiling Sunflowers' Solitude</title><body>
Sophia lived in a little blue house with a big, sunny garden. Her garden wasn't just any garden; it was a riot of colors and smells. But the very best part of her garden, Sophia thought, were the sunflowers. They were tall and proud, with faces like giant sunshine circles, always turning their heads to follow the sun.

Sophia loved to sing, and her voice was like a tiny, tinkling bell. Every morning, as the sun peeked over the hills, she would walk among the sunflowers and sing them songs. She sang about fluffy clouds, playful kittens, and buzzing bees. Her songs were always happy, and the sunflowers always seemed to listen very, very carefully.

One day, a very important visitor came to the garden. It was Mrs. Higgins, the baker from the village. Mrs. Higgins had a very important mission: to bake a cake for the King’s birthday! She needed sunflower seeds – lots and lots of sunflower seeds – to make a special, sunny-flavored cake.

Sophia was delighted to meet Mrs. Higgins. She loved cakes, especially sunny-flavored ones. Mrs. Higgins explained about the King's cake, and how delicious it would be.

"My, those sunflowers are splendid," Mrs. Higgins said, admiring the tall plants. "They're the perfect kind! Could I perhaps take some of the seeds, dear?"

Sophia's smile faded a little. She looked at the sunflowers, and then she looked at Mrs. Higgins. She knew that sunflowers made delicious seeds, that were indeed an integral part of Mrs Higgins cake. But Sophia didn't want her friends, the sunflowers, to be hurt, or be without their beautiful, healthy seeds. "But...but what will happen to them?" Sophia asked, her voice barely a whisper. "If you take all their seeds, what will they do?"

Mrs. Higgins, whose kind face had a worried line appear on it, scratched her chin. "Well, the sunflowers would provide their seeds," she began, "which allow their children to blossom and flourish." Then, realising Sophia's point she continued to explain to her, "Without the seeds they provide, how will the sunflowers grow the children to bloom and grow?"

Sophia was confused.

Mrs. Higgins patted Sophia's head gently. "My dear, you are sweet. We'll figure something out."

And so, they did. Together, they spent the next few hours observing the sunflowers. Sophia explained all about the plant’s cycle, what they ate, what helped them grow.

"The sunflowers will shed their seeds when they are ready," Sophia declared. "It's their way of spreading their happiness."

Mrs. Higgins nodded and observed that each sunflower was shedding seeds that would feed other children and continue to thrive and bloom and become the happy smiling sunshine they are. They decided they would only take a small amount of seeds, just enough for the cake. They left most of the seeds on the sunflowers so that new sunflowers could grow in the spring, next to their family.

Mrs. Higgins decided the sunny cake would come back to the garden in the shape of sunflower petals.

Over the next few days, Mrs. Higgins spent her time visiting Sophia in her little blue house. She also invited the town children and brought them together with Sophia and the sunflowers. Every morning the little children were the ones helping gather the seeds for the cake. They also enjoyed themselves, playing hide-and-seek and jumping around in a circle.

Sophia and the town children learned all about sunflowers. They discovered that sunflower seeds could be eaten as delicious and tasty snacks. Sophia made sunflower seed pancakes and invited the town children to have lunch with her. All of the sunflowers smiled when all of the children were enjoying the food.

Mrs. Higgins also taught Sophia how to plant new seeds and care for baby sunflowers. She helped the children measure and prepare the perfect little seeds so they would be happy and thrive as tall as the others.

Together, they collected a small basket of seeds from the tallest sunflowers, only from those that were fully ready. Sophia, remembering her concern, was extremely happy to ensure that the sunflowers kept enough to look after their family. Then, they began the baking process.

Mrs. Higgins was so happy and grateful for Sophia's help. She knew the cake would be the most sunny and special cake in the whole Kingdom. She said that the secret ingredient to the King's sunny cake was the love Sophia had for the sunflowers.

Back in her kitchen, Mrs. Higgins carefully ground the sunflower seeds. She mixed them with flour, sugar, eggs, and a touch of sunshine-flavored flavoring, especially added so the sunflowers wouldn’t be so alone in the cake. The aroma was heavenly; the entire village could smell the sweetness wafting through the air. The air began to sing, the sun shining the most brilliantly of all.

As the cake baked, Mrs. Higgins added some specially chosen sunflower seeds on top so that they would have more love and make more smiling faces in the world.

Finally, the cake was ready! It was a golden masterpiece, topped with the sunny-flavored icing and special sunflower decorations.

When the day of the King's birthday arrived, the entire village gathered. The parade was a sight to behold, everyone knew the special birthday treat Mrs. Higgins made. There were people with musical instruments playing a merry tune; little girls dancing and spinning, jumping up and down. Sophia, in her prettiest dress, carried a small bouquet of miniature sunflowers. The crowd all stopped.

Mrs. Higgins placed the King's cake. Everyone was silent as the King blew out the candles.

Everyone cheered at the sight. Then, it was time to eat.

When the King finally tasted the cake, his eyes widened with joy. "It tastes like sunshine and happiness!" he boomed.

He looked directly at Sophia and thanked her for her part. The people gathered around, everyone thanking Sophia too. It was a delicious cake, and one that wouldn't have been possible without Sophia's care for her sunflowers.

Sophia, standing next to Mrs. Higgins, smiled widely, even more widely than the sunflowers. She wasn't worried about the sunflowers anymore. She knew they were still sharing their sunshine, helping people and spreading happiness, even in the form of a delicious cake.

Back in the little blue house, Sophia continued to sing her songs to the sunflowers. They swayed gently in the breeze, their faces turned toward the sun, and listening to her songs. They all understood Sophia’s feelings and together they were all very happy.

From that day on, Sophia continued her habit. She looked at the smiling faces. She knew they understood their purpose: their purpose of living was to spread happiness to all the world. Every day that they watched over her in the little blue house and every day as the sun rose and began the day’s new venture, Sophia, Mrs. Higgins, the sunflowers, the king, the town people - they were a happy, little bunch indeed. The sunflowers now knew there wasn’t anything wrong with being a little bit in solitude, after all. In this way, she kept the garden safe, making the little garden, forever known, to the smiling sunflowers' solitude. And their happiness shone as bright as the sun itself.
