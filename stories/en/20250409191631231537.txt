<title>Percival's Pursuit of the Precious Pearl and Posh Parrot.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled amongst rolling green hills and shimmering, sapphire seas, lay the quaint little village of Bumblebrook. And in Bumblebrook lived a small boy named Percival. Percival was known for his adventurous spirit and his enormous imagination. He loved nothing more than to dream up fantastic quests and imagine himself as a brave explorer, a cunning detective, or even, sometimes, a fearsome dragon (though, thankfully, he wasn't very good at roaring).

One particularly bright and sunny morning, as Percival was meticulously arranging his collection of pebbles (each one named and meticulously categorized by its geological qualities, of course!), he received a most unexpected visitor. It was old Mrs. Higgins, the village’s wisest woman, who everyone said could ‘smell a secret from a mile away.’

Mrs. Higgins, with her twinkling eyes and a bun piled high with graying hair, beckoned him over with a slightly crooked finger. She had a strange, almost knowing smile plastered across her face. "Percival, my boy," she whispered, leaning in close. "I have a task for you, a very important task indeed."

Percival, instantly captivated, forgot all about the geological perfection of the ‘Sparkling Granite’ he was about to add to the collection. "Oh, yes, Mrs. Higgins! Anything! Tell me everything!"

Mrs. Higgins placed a small, velvet pouch into his eager hands. It was heavy, hinting at the treasure it concealed. "Inside this pouch, Percival, is a very important map. It leads to the legendary Precious Pearl, said to grant its owner the greatest wish. However, protecting the map and the treasure from any undesirable types is the task of another precious companion..." Mrs. Higgins paused for dramatic effect. "A Posh Parrot!"

Percival's eyes widened. A Precious Pearl and a Posh Parrot? This was better than a dragon, far better! "A Posh Parrot?" he echoed, barely able to contain his excitement. "But… where is the map leading? Who has the Posh Parrot? Is it…is it in Bumblebrook?"

Mrs. Higgins chuckled, her wrinkles deepening around her eyes. "Patience, young Percival, patience. The map within will lead you on a grand adventure. But before you go, you must be warned. This quest is not for the faint of heart. You will encounter challenges. You will face riddles. You must be brave, Percival. The fate of the Precious Pearl rests in your hands.”

She then gently squeezed Percival's shoulder and disappeared as quickly as she had come, leaving Percival clutching the velvet pouch and bursting with anticipation.

Inside the pouch, nestled carefully in a bed of soft silk, was the map. It was a beautifully drawn parchment, filled with swirling lines, cryptic symbols, and faded colours that looked as old as time. At the top was written: “To the location of the Precious Pearl, guarded by the Posh Parrot: Begin at the Whispering Waterfall. Follow the path of the Singing Stream.”

Percival, a whirlwind of excitement, immediately set off on his quest. He carefully packed a small bag with essential supplies: a magnifying glass (for studying clues), a notebook and pencil (for recording important observations), a small, crusty sandwich (in case hunger struck), and a whistle (for emergencies… or just for whistling!).

He raced to the Whispering Waterfall, a cascading curtain of water that tumbled down the side of a rocky cliff. The sound of the water rushing over the rocks filled the air, creating a soothing, almost musical melody. Percival studied the base of the waterfall, following the path of the Singing Stream as directed on the map. The stream meandered through a lush green meadow, dotted with colourful wildflowers and buzzing with busy bees.

Along the banks of the stream, Percival discovered the first clue: a small, perfectly formed feather, shimmering with emerald and sapphire colours. He carefully wrote about it in his notebook and added the observation, “Feather suggests the existence of birds. Posh Parrot nearby?”. Following the stream, he reached a rickety wooden bridge, just barely held together by weathered planks and frayed ropes. He hesitated, glancing at his magnifying glass which was also an integral piece of his equipment, because he was certain this adventure was the first of many to come. He took a deep breath and, clutching his bag, started to walk across the bridge. He had to step very carefully, but it held, creaking and groaning with every footstep. On the other side of the bridge, etched into a large oak tree, he found the second clue: a small riddle. It read:

*“I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?”*

Percival thought long and hard, pacing back and forth, twisting the strap of his bag in his hands. "Cities...forests...water... but no houses, trees, or fish…” He tried out all his favourite types of maps but none of them made sense at first!

Suddenly, it struck him! The answer was a map, of course! The very thing he was following! He smiled with his moment of realization. Elated at his success, he followed the stream further, heading toward the tallest tree he could find in the clearing, and saw an indication on his map leading him straight there. The tree was the home of a large bird’s nest. This could mean many different possibilities!

The Singing Stream continued through a dense forest. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. Sunlight dappled through the leaves, casting dancing shadows on the forest floor. After a short time following the path indicated in his map, the direction eventually ended up pointing towards a narrow and hidden path that began within a wall of tightly packed bushes. As soon as Percival began walking through it, the branches scratched his face.

As the path opened, he was surprised. The trail led directly to a small, secret clearing. At the center of the clearing, perched upon a golden swing, was a magnificent parrot. The parrot was a kaleidoscope of vibrant colours – scarlet, azure, emerald, and gold. It preened its feathers, and its bright, intelligent eyes watched him. It truly was posh!

"Good day!" the parrot squawked, its voice surprisingly posh and melodious. "And who might you be, traipsing through my domain?"

Percival, a little awestruck, cleared his throat and introduced himself. "I am Percival, sir! I… I am on a quest for the Precious Pearl, and Mrs. Higgins told me you would have a part in my journey!"

The Posh Parrot preened, smoothing a vibrant red feather. "Indeed! I am Bartholomew, at your service. And, the Precious Pearl is safe with me, of course. However," he paused with a twinkle in his eye, "you must answer one final riddle to claim it.”

Percival's heart leaped. So near, yet so far!

"Tell me this riddle," Bartholomew continued, "What has an eye, but cannot see?"

Percival pondered, thinking quickly. He looked around the clearing and noticed an antique, old fashioned eye-shaped key hole within the surrounding forest walls. "An eye... but cannot see..."

Then it clicked! A needle! Of course!

"A needle!" Percival declared with great certainty, he remembered everything in the history of all the great quests he’d ever learned about!

Bartholomew let out a squawk of approval. "Very good, young Percival! You are indeed worthy. You've navigated the treacherous trials and solved all the cryptic clues. Here is the key, the Precious Pearl!"

From a velvet pouch tied around his neck, Bartholomew presented a glistening pearl. It glowed with an inner light, seeming to pulse with a gentle energy.

“I hear, too, the Precious Pearl only answers to an honest wish, so make it count.” Bartholomew smiled, very content with the journey, and, to show the young Percival the way out, extended his wing towards the exit route.

Percival’s head felt like it would explode, but was glad it didn’t. He could barely contain his delight, and as he did, his mind began filling up with wishes. Should he wish for candy? For a mountain of toys? For endless adventures? Suddenly, Percival had a memory of the lonely and sad little lady, next to whom, he could not help, but have seen his friends walk away from on their way home on the trail today…
“Wait… what is this place?” he wondered out loud.

The Posh Parrot, realizing Percival wasn’t going to say anything further looked down at the velvet pouch which Percival still clutched in his hand and nodded slowly. “Remember the words that guide you through the trials.”

Percival nodded too. “Begin at the Whispering Waterfall. Follow the path of the Singing Stream,”

With a great heave of the breath, and after realizing this adventure has shown him that adventure is as much of a discovery of himself, as is adventure a means to finding things, he spoke to Bartholomew with much happiness and gave him a thank you.

Percival then held the pearl tight, closed his eyes, and made his wish, an honest wish.

When he opened his eyes again, he didn’t have candy, or mountains of toys. However, he did have his friends! But much more than that… a much bigger collection of the joy within his heart. A joy that kept multiplying, and was set to become a whole new adventure, starting very soon, with a posh friend!

And so, Percival, armed with his experience, his collection of observations and his newfound joy, continued his days in Bumblebrook, always ready for a new adventure, because, thanks to his quest for the Precious Pearl, he knew the greatest treasure of all was not found in the magic pearl, or the map of its pursuit, but within the courage and determination of Percival himself.
