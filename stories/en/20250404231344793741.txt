<title>Finding Courage to Try Something New Today</title>
<body>
"Wake up, Lily! Wake up!" squeaked Pip, his tiny voice almost lost in the morning breeze.

Lily, snuggled deep in her bed, mumbled, "Go away, Pip. It's still sleepy time."

Pip, a small, energetic sparrow, flitted to her bedside, his bright eyes shining. "But Lily, the sun is up! And today is a special day!"

Lily groaned and slowly sat up, pushing tangled brown hair out of her eyes. "Special how? Is it someone's birthday?"

"Even better!" chirped Pip, bouncing on the window sill. "It's 'Try Something New' Day! Mrs. Higgins announced it in the meadow this morning. Everyone is trying something they've never done before!"

Lily yawned again. "Trying something new sounds… tiring."

Pip puffed out his chest. "But it's exciting! Barnaby Badger is going to try to climb a tree. And Rosie Rabbit is going to attempt to skip rope! Imagine all the adventures!"

Lily remained unconvinced. "I like doing what I always do. Reading books, drawing pictures… It’s safe and comfortable.” She reached for her favourite storybook.

"But don't you ever wonder what else is out there, Lily?" Pip perched on her shoulder, his head tilted inquisitively. "Don't you ever wish you could fly like me?"

Lily giggled. "Of course I do! But I don't have wings."

"Exactly! But that's why trying new things is important. You might discover you're even more amazing than you thought!"

Lily sighed. “I don't know, Pip. I’m not very good at things I haven’t tried before.”

“That’s okay!” Pip chirped again. "It doesn't matter if you’re good at it! It's the trying that counts! So, what are you going to try, Lily? Come on, it will be so much fun. Just this once?"

Lily considered. "Well… what's there to try?"

Pip hopped up and down with glee. “There are so many things! Barnaby said you could try… gardening! He’s planted a lovely herb garden, you can check it out later. Or, Rosie rabbit is going to a special yoga class."

Lily’s eyebrows furrowed. “Gardening? And… yoga? I don’t know, Pip. They sound…"

"Hard?" Pip completed, his tone curious.

“Maybe. And I might fail. I don't want to fail."

Pip hopped closer to Lily’s face. “Lily, listen! No one ever masters something on the first try. Everyone struggles, even me! Remember when I first tried to sing a song with the blackbirds? It sounded terrible, a screeching squawk."

Lily giggled again. "I remember. They all flew away!”

"Exactly! But I didn't give up. I kept practicing, and now… well, I'm the best songbird around!” Pip winked.

“But I don’t want to be a best songbird. Or climb trees like Barnaby.”

"Alright, how about this? Maybe you could bake something? Mrs. Higgins will probably share her chocolate chip cookies." Pip’s eyes gleamed.

Lily’s face lit up. "Chocolate chip cookies?"

"Yes! And you could follow the recipe. It would be just like reading a book, except… you eat the pages!"

Lily giggled, imagining eating the pages of a recipe book. “That does sound a little more tempting…but baking sounds messy.”

"Everything can seem messy. But imagine biting into a cookie you’ve created all by yourself! And with Mrs. Higgins nearby, you have a safety net if you need one."

After some deliberation, Lily's reluctance began to fade. The image of warm cookies made her mouth water. "Okay, Pip," she said, a tiny smile playing on her lips. "Okay, let's try it. Let's bake cookies."

"Yay!" cried Pip, fluttering around her head. "That’s the spirit! Now, let's go! Mrs. Higgins is probably already getting started."

They hurried to the meadow where Mrs. Higgins, a kind old hedgehog, was setting up a baking station. There were measuring cups, bowls, and various ingredients lined up on a table made of a large, flat rock.

"Good morning, Lily!" greeted Mrs. Higgins, her voice warm and welcoming. "Ready to bake?"

Lily felt a flutter of nerves, but seeing Mrs. Higgins's smile gave her courage. “Yes, Mrs. Higgins. I’m going to try to make chocolate chip cookies.”

"Wonderful! Pip told me," Mrs. Higgins chuckled. "The first time is always a little tricky. Don't worry, I will guide you."

Mrs. Higgins pulled out a recipe, and together they began. Lily, following Mrs. Higgins's instructions, slowly and carefully mixed the butter and sugar. Her small hands clumsily poured in the flour, and she felt a bit worried when she dropped some of the flour on the table, making a puff of white.

"Oh dear," Lily muttered, her cheeks flushed.

"Don't worry about a bit of flour, Lily," Mrs. Higgins said kindly. "It's just the magic dust that helps the cookies become tasty treats." She laughed. "And that’s what will make them even more beautiful.”

Pip watched from the windowsill, chirping encouragement. "You can do it, Lily! It's looking great!"

Lily stirred and then carefully added the chocolate chips, feeling a surge of pride as she did.

“You are doing great!” encouraged Mrs. Higgins. “Baking isn't just following the instructions. It is the feeling you add in when you put together the elements.”

The mixing bowl was a wonderful thing to watch as Lily got her hands on it. The smell of the butter and ingredients made her tummy rumble.

The dough felt so interesting; she rolled some into little balls.

As the oven heated, they placed the dough on a tray and sent them into the oven. While they waited, they chatted about all sorts of things. Mrs. Higgins told Lily stories about when she was a child. Pip shared stories of the various places he flew around the meadow.

As time passed, Lily looked through the windows and thought about how much the adventure would taste when the cookies were ready.

When the oven timer beeped, signaling the cookies were done, Lily peeked inside, and a delicious aroma wafted through the air. She took the tray out, and as they began to cool, Lily was proud and excited. The cookies were golden brown, with melted chocolate chips.

“They look wonderful!” exclaimed Pip.

Lily was incredibly excited and took a cookie immediately. She took a small bite and closed her eyes, savouring the flavour. They were warm and melty, buttery and chocolatey.

“They are amazing!” she declared, beaming.

"See, Lily?" said Mrs. Higgins, smiling. "You did it! You tried something new and you made something delicious!"

Just then, Barnaby Badger, covered in mud but beaming with pride, approached them. "I did it!" he puffed. "I climbed halfway up a tree! And then I took a nap on a branch."

Rosie Rabbit hopped over, holding a skipping rope, her cheeks rosy from exertion. "I managed to skip ten times without tripping!" she announced proudly.

Everyone celebrated, sharing their new experiences. They laughed and encouraged one another. Lily, feeling a warm glow inside, understood what Pip had been talking about. The thrill wasn't just in succeeding; it was in the trying, the facing of fears, and the joy of discovering new things about yourself.

“I…I feel happy,” Lily admitted, taking another bite of her cookie. “I’m glad I tried this.”

Pip landed on her shoulder. “See? It wasn’t so scary, was it? And you were even braver, you didn't shy away. The cookies are pretty good too.”

"Not at all, Pip," Lily agreed, her heart swelling with newfound courage. "I might even try to… skip rope tomorrow. I will give a few tries"

"Yes! And I'll keep you motivated! What adventure will we have?" exclaimed Pip, flitting up and down, already planning their next adventure.

Lily smiled, feeling a sense of excitement she hadn't felt before. She ate a cookie, taking her time and enjoying every morsel. It wasn’t just about cookies; it was about pushing her boundaries, embracing challenges, and knowing that even when things were messy, and difficult, trying something new could bring the greatest rewards. The warmth from her heart went into her stomach, filling her body with satisfaction and joy. From that day on, Lily always knew to make herself open to new experiences. And when she felt like she might fail, she reminded herself, ‘I did it before, and I can certainly do it again.’
