<title>Alice Ant’s Busy Day Carrying Food Across the Tall Grass.</title><body>
"Good morning, sunshine!" chirped Alice Ant, stretching her tiny legs and antennae.

"Good morning, Alice!" replied Ferdinand Beetle, meticulously polishing his shiny shell. "Busy day ahead?"

Alice nodded, her antennae twitching with excitement. "Indeed, Ferdinand! There's a picnic basket dropped near the oak tree. Imagine the feast! We'll need to get a whole colony involved."

Ferdinand’s mandibles (jaws) clicked with interest. "A picnic, you say? Oh my, the potential crumbs alone!"

"Exactly! Let's get the word out! We can't let the grasshoppers or those greedy spiders get to it first!" Alice scurried off towards the anthill, a flurry of activity in her wake.

"Alright! Right away, Alice!" Ferdinand called after her, before resuming his shell-polishing, although his antennae twitched with eagerness too.

Inside the anthill, Alice called, "Hello! Hello everyone! Gather round! Urgent announcement!"

A crowd of ants emerged, blinking sleepily. They all had variations of the name of Alice. Some were Alice-Brown, Alice-Spot, Alice-Longlegs, Alice-Antenna and a very tired looking Alice-Zzzzzzz.

"A picnic! Outside! Near the big oak!" Alice repeated, her voice ringing with anticipation.

"Picnic?" squeaked Alice-Brown. "But it’s so early!"

"There might be a biscuit!" gasped Alice-Spot, eyes widening with delight.

"Or cheese! Oh, the cheese!" murmured Alice-Longlegs, already imagining the delicacies.

"Quick! We must organise!" cried Alice-Antenna, her long antennae quivering with anticipation.

Alice-Zzzzzzz, still groggy, simply yawned.

"Right, listen up!" declared Alice, her voice taking charge. "Alice-Brown, you and a team go scout. Find the easiest path to the picnic. Alice-Spot, you're in charge of gathering crumbs. Alice-Longlegs, you’re in charge of transporting the biggest pieces. Alice-Antenna, you help me rally the rest. And Alice-Zzzzzzz... you're on break!"

Alice-Zzzzzzz’s eyes perked up immediately, "Break? Right! Count me in!"

With a collective buzz of excitement, the ants dispersed. Alice, followed by Alice-Antenna, began organizing the larger, stronger ants, assigning tasks.

“Remember everyone," Alice-Antenna said. "Work together! Stay in single file to avoid the spiders’ webs!"

Outside the anthill, Alice-Brown and her scouting team cautiously made their way through the towering blades of grass. The world felt enormous from their perspective.

“Watch out for the giant feet!” whispered Alice-Brown, referring to the human picnic-goers.

"And the splashing!" squeaked a tiny scout ant, remembering a previous rain shower.

They navigated carefully, spotting tiny dangers such as hungry ladybirds, lurking spiders and puddles formed from water droplets on the grass blades.

Meanwhile, Ferdinand Beetle was diligently polishing his shell, occasionally gazing towards the picnic area.

Suddenly, a small voice yelled, “I see it! I see the picnic basket!”

Alice-Brown's team raced back, panting with information. "It's right near the big oak tree! Loads of food! But... there are some of those big, yellow creatures..."

“Oh dear,” groaned Alice-Antenna, thinking of the yellow jackets, notoriously difficult creatures. “The picnic-goers will cause chaos! Quick, Alice, we must act quickly before those human giants step on us.”

"Don’t worry. I've got a plan!" said Alice, confidence swelling in her chest. "We’ll distract them!"

Back at the anthill, Alice-Spot's crumb-gathering squad prepared to carry off any small crumbs and stray flakes. Alice-Longlegs began coordinating her team to target anything from whole sandwiches to half eaten cupcakes. The ants looked around, trying to memorise the layout, but a quick glance proved difficult to see the entire field from so low.

"Here we go! Carry with pride!" Alice encouraged the ants.

Alice devised a multi-pronged strategy. First, they would use the wind to waft the scent of particularly tempting crumbs towards the far side of the picnic blanket, luring the yellow jackets away from the juicier items. Then, she'd mobilize the larger ants, each one armed with a small pebble, to create a distraction.

With Alice-Antenna organizing everything in the centre, the colony advanced. Alice-Brown’s team started the work by finding suitable twigs, acting as levers. Other ants worked by digging a makeshift channel which could be used as a path for the crumbs. Alice-Spot and her squad started the main part of the strategy, with a steady stream of ants bringing food particles, making a trail that curved round.

“Keep going! Almost there!” called Alice-Spot.

The crumbs’ trail made the yellow jackets buzzing with anticipation. Many had abandoned their positions near the most exciting food sources such as honey and jam, which were near the apple.

The next step of the plan, creating distractions, was then enacted. Teams of strong ants set out and gently pushed pebbles, creating noise and moving away some of the bigger obstacles.

Finally, it was time for the big haul. Alice-Longlegs and her team, carrying enormous crumbs, attempted to move them back to the anthill, despite being very slow. However, many smaller, much more agile, ants came and took over.

All the ants advanced as a single unit. A little one saw that a large slice of apple had been carelessly left.

“It is the moment!” she thought. “This is the food we’ve been dreaming of!”

The ants set to work, a swarm, a tide, and slowly began moving, working tirelessly, towards the prize.

Their efforts were eventually realised, even if a lot of work was required. Alice was pleased, as were all her fellow ants, despite being exhausted. They were on their way to victory.

Suddenly, a large foot thundered down, followed by another! It was time to stop working!

“Quick! Hide!” yelled Alice, her voice sharp with panic. The ants scattered, diving under blades of grass, into the shade, wherever they could find shelter. The two feet retreated. The giant human beings didn't remain there long. They began to pack up and leave.

Once the footsteps faded, Alice cautiously poked her head out, scanning the area for danger. Everything was still.

“Everyone! Come out!” she shouted, her voice filled with relief.

Slowly, tentatively, the ants re-emerged, their faces shining with relief. It appeared as if no-one had been stepped on.

“Whew! That was close!” exclaimed Alice-Brown.

“Did you see the jam, the honey and the cookies?” asked Alice-Spot, her eyes gleaming with remembered sweetness.

“Right!” exclaimed Alice-Longlegs, dusting off a particularly enormous crumb. “Back to work! We are almost there! What a glorious day.”

“Good job, everyone!” declared Alice, with a happy chirp. “Back to the anthill! And be careful with those delicious scraps!”

Ferdinand, having finished polishing his shell and finally seeing the movement of the ants, rolled over and exclaimed to himself: “This is what I call proper hard work! What is life, if not good, old-fashioned effort?” He watched them go, his mandibles twitching in what might have been an approving smile. He, like the picnic-goers, knew it was time for a rest.

As the ants returned to the anthill, each with their share of the picnic’s treasure, the sun began to dip below the horizon. The grass, in its deep green, stretched around them. Alice turned to Alice-Antenna and winked.

“Another busy day, wouldn’t you say?” Alice said with a satisfied sigh.

"Indeed, Alice. Another successful day! But tomorrow we have to start all over. Maybe then, the weather will be in our favour" replied Alice-Antenna.

"Yes, but, Alice," interjected Alice-Zzzzzzz, stifling a yawn. "Can we maybe have a break on the work, please?"

Alice chuckled and winked.

“Alright, alright," she said to Alice-Zzzzzzz. “A break is a good thing. Now, what about the cookies and chocolate? Remember them.”

The ants continued their path into their anthill, bringing crumbs and memories with them as the evening gently washed over the green grass. The feast was almost complete. Alice’s Busy Day had finished, but she would never stop bringing food for her friends!

The End.
