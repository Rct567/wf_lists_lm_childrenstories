<title>The Bravest Dog and His Rescue From The Storm</title>
<body>
Barnaby Button was, without a shadow of a doubt, the bravest dog in Bumblebrook. Now, Bumblebrook wasn’t a town known for its daredevils, or indeed, for anything particularly exciting. It was a place of gentle hills, sleepy sheep, and Mrs. Higgins's prize-winning petunias. Barnaby, a scruffy terrier mix with one ear perpetually flopped over, found this rather dull.

Barnaby yearned for adventure! He longed to be the hero, the rescuer, the…well, anything slightly less boring than chasing squirrels (which, he must admit, was also quite fun). He practised heroic poses in front of the mirror, a tarnished old tin can that had been thrown out by Mr. Grumbles the baker. He imagined himself saving fluffy kittens from the perilous heights of the oak tree (a height of approximately three feet, by the way) and rescuing unsuspecting children from the clutches of… well, nobody really, because Bumblebrook was usually quite safe.

One Tuesday, however, Bumblebrook got its adventure. The sky, usually a cheerful blue, turned a grumpy grey. The wind began to whistle, a mischievous sort of whistle that tugged at your ears and made the window panes rattle. Raindrops, fat and splodgy, started to fall. Then, things escalated. The wind howled like a banshee, the rain turned torrential, and the usually gentle river Bumble began to swell, overflowing its banks and threatening to flood the lower parts of the town.

Everyone, of course, panicked. Mrs. Higgins clutched her petunias (understandably) and started wailing, Mr. Grumbles (who wasn't so grumpy when it came to a good crisis) ran about shouting, "The biscuits! The biscuits!" and the children, quite sensibly, hid under their beds.

Barnaby, however, felt a thrill! This was it! His chance! He barked with delight, then immediately felt a bit foolish for enjoying the impending disaster, but the opportunity was just too good to miss. He watched, ears pricked, as the river continued to rise. He noted that Mrs. Wobblebottom, the eccentric old woman who lived on the edge of the river in a rather ramshackle houseboat (it had previously been a shed, then a chicken coop), was nowhere to be seen.

The houseboat, the "HMS Wibblebottom," was beginning to tilt precariously. Barnaby realised, with a sudden jolt of adrenaline, that Mrs. Wobblebottom was probably inside!

Without a second thought (and with a slightly soggy whimper of excitement), Barnaby bolted towards the raging river. The current was fierce, pulling at his legs, and the wind nearly bowled him over. He spluttered, paddled, and pushed, his small body working overtime against the elements. He was getting closer to the wobbling, wildly swaying houseboat.

Reaching the HMS Wibblebottom was no mean feat. The steps to the porch were completely underwater, but luckily, there was a rope trailing from the deck. With a gargle and a gulp, Barnaby, paddling as fast as his stubby legs could move, grabbed onto the rope and started hauling himself, dog-paddle style, towards the boat.

He managed to scrabble onto the wet, slippery deck. The door of the houseboat was practically underwater, but Barnaby could hear a faint, high-pitched sound coming from inside.

“Heeelp!”

It was Mrs. Wobblebottom!

The door, weakened by years of rain and questionable craftsmanship, was practically giving way. With a determined bark and a heave, Barnaby threw his weight against the door. It didn't budge. He barked again, and this time, he managed to lodge his paw into a small gap. Another heave!

The door finally popped open.

Inside, Mrs. Wobblebottom was perched on a rickety stool, surrounded by overflowing teacups and a collection of rubber ducks, one of which was bobbing towards the rising water. She was wearing a floral dressing gown and a rather fetching, if slightly askew, bonnet.

“Oh, my goodness gracious, a dog!” she squeaked, blinking through her enormous spectacles. “And in this weather! You brave, brave chap!”

Barnaby, still dripping and panting, barked again, as if to say, "Now's not the time for chit-chat! Get out of here!"

Mrs. Wobblebottom, to her credit, seemed to understand. She clutched a small, fluffy Persian cat to her chest, which had miraculously remained dry, and followed Barnaby out onto the deck.

Getting Mrs. Wobblebottom and her Persian cat to safety was a whole different ball game. The houseboat was rocking violently, and the current was getting stronger. Barnaby, seeing his mission, made the daring plan (which was just an idea, not a real plan!) that they should try and swim for it. The river's edge was too far, too dangerous; they had to find something!

Barnaby, remembering his training, yipped excitedly at the lady. He had the rope in his mouth. The woman knew the best approach as she also clutched to the rope, alongside the cat.

Barnaby then jumped, swimming expertly through the water, and towed Mrs. Wobblebottom toward the riverbank, guiding her safely. He swam past floating debris. He had done this! The water pulled at them, so he ensured his swimming was good and precise.

"Heeelp!" the brave dog could still hear Mrs. Higgins as she was screaming. Barnaby didn't like shouting and screams so he picked up his pace in swimming. After a few minutes, Barnaby noticed the shouts stopped. Surely Mrs Higgins had been saved... or she had been swept away.

Once they reached the safety of the riverbank, Mrs. Wobblebottom, with the wet cat nestled safely, looked at Barnaby and gave him a great big hug. "You are the bravest dog I have ever known! What a wonderful dog you are! Thank you, thank you, from the bottom of my rather soggy heart!"

And then, a surprising thing happened. As they were safely situated on the muddy bank, Mrs. Higgins, soaked to the skin, was coming along toward them. She ran, she screamed, she then collapsed down, crying, "Barnaby, thank goodness you are alright! Barnaby, I can't bear the thought of my petunias, and so many are washed away! I..."

The shouts, then a sudden loud cough from the woman interrupted her. "And, and Mrs. Wobblebottom! I'm saved, I'm saved, thank goodness, and it's you who saved us! Thank goodness!"

Barnaby, puffed up with pride (and quite a bit of wet fur), looked at Mrs. Wobblebottom, at Mrs. Higgins, at his wet feet, and then, a small, heroic tear rolled down his furry cheek. He had done it! He was a hero! He had faced the raging river and triumphed.

As the rain finally started to ease and the sun peeked shyly from behind the clouds, the grateful residents of Bumblebrook gathered around. Mr. Grumbles offered Barnaby a biscuit (he had salvaged a few from the flood) and Mrs. Higgins declared him a true hero. She even named one of her newly rescued petunias "Barnaby's Brave Blossom," a deep red bloom, just like the inside of Barnaby's brave, little heart.

From that day on, Barnaby Button was no longer just a scruffy terrier mix. He was Barnaby Button, the bravest dog in Bumblebrook. He continued to patrol the town, always on the lookout for adventure (or, at the very least, squirrels). He still practiced heroic poses in front of Mr. Grumbles’s tarnished tin can (which he'd asked to keep, in memory of a great day!), though he spent most days sleeping near a fireplace, with the Persian cat of the old woman, and her special hot tea which was like no other tea around the town. He now found, although adventures and excitements are the best things of all, so were good sleeps.

And every now and then, as the river Bumble flowed peacefully through the little town, someone would say, “Remember the storm? Remember Barnaby?” And everyone would smile, because in Bumblebrook, even in the face of a raging river, a brave little dog had proven that even the smallest of heroes could make the biggest difference. He would wag his tail at the story!

The end.
