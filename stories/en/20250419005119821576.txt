<title>George and the Giant, Grumpy Gorilla</title>
<body>
George lived in a small, blue house with a very big garden. His garden wasn't just filled with flowers and green grass; it was also home to a giant, grumpy gorilla named Gregory. Gregory was very big – much bigger than George's house, in fact! He had grey fur, enormous hands, and a frown that always seemed to be stuck on his face.

Every day, George would go out to his garden to play. He'd build sandcastles, swing on the old tire swing hanging from a big oak tree, and chase after butterflies. But Gregory the gorilla would always be there, slumped against the giant oak, looking utterly miserable.

"Good morning, Gregory!" George would call out, trying to be friendly.

Gregory would just grunt. He wouldn’t even open his eyes sometimes.

George wasn’t scared of Gregory. He knew, deep down, that even though Gregory looked grumpy, he wasn’t really mean. George thought Gregory was probably just… lonely.

One sunny afternoon, George decided to try something different. He skipped over to where Gregory was sitting. This time, instead of saying hello, George sat down on the grass a safe distance away. He pulled out his favorite book, "The Adventures of Captain Bluebeard," and started to read aloud.

"Captain Bluebeard sailed the stormy seas," George read, his voice clear and bright, "searching for buried treasure on a mysterious island…"

Gregory stirred. His big, furry head twitched. George kept reading, lost in the pirate's tale.

After a few pages, George heard a small sniffle. He looked up. Gregory's huge shoulders were shaking, and a tear rolled down his furry cheek.

George stopped reading. He walked closer, feeling a bit worried. "Are you alright, Gregory?" he asked gently.

Gregory let out a huge sigh, which sounded like the wind blowing through the leaves of the oak tree. He finally opened his eyes. They were a watery grey.

"I… I miss the jungle," Gregory rumbled, his voice deep and scratchy.

George didn’t understand. "The jungle?"

Gregory nodded. "I used to live in a big jungle, full of trees and other gorillas. But… I got lost. I don't know how I got here. Now I just miss the jungle."

George sat down next to Gregory. He thought about what Gregory said. He knew that sometimes, being lost made people feel very, very sad. He knew that feeling.

"That sounds… awful," George said quietly. "Do you… do you miss your friends too?"

Another big sniffle. "Yes," Gregory whispered. "I miss my family."

George understood loneliness. Even in his own, big garden, he sometimes felt a little lonely too.

“I know what it’s like to miss your family,” George said. "My grandma and grandpa live very far away." He patted Gregory’s enormous hand. “Do you want me to read to you some more?”

Gregory looked surprised. Then, he nodded.

George continued reading. He read about pirates and buried treasure, but he also started reading about friendship and family. He read about brave adventurers who were never truly alone because they had each other. George chose books about brave animals who always missed their own families, even if they were far away.

Slowly, slowly, Gregory’s grumpiness started to fade. The sniffling became less frequent. Sometimes, a very small smile would tug at the corners of his mouth. He still remained grumpy, of course, but he no longer looked as miserable.

Each day, George would visit Gregory, reading him stories and talking to him. He discovered that Gregory loved banana pancakes, which George started to sneak into the garden with him. The pancakes helped too. George would sit close to Gregory on a blanket. It was tricky; the giant gorilla took up the most space.

Sometimes, George would bring his drawing books, and draw pictures for Gregory. He'd draw pictures of jungles, of gorillas, of banana trees and maybe George’s blue house. He drew lots of happy faces.

One day, George was reading a story about a young boy who had to sail across the sea. George realised something.

"Gregory," George said suddenly, looking up from his book. "Maybe we could… build you a jungle in our garden!"

Gregory perked up. He tilted his head. "Build a jungle?"

"Well," George said, thinking hard. "We can't build *all* of it, but we could try! We could plant lots of trees, and build you a treehouse! And maybe even get some… some banana trees!"

Gregory’s eyes widened. "Banana trees?" he repeated in a rumbling voice. He was smiling now, properly. It wasn’t a small smile, but a huge, gorilla smile that almost split his face.

And so, George and Gregory began to build a jungle. It took a long, long time, and it involved a lot of work. First, they asked George’s mum if they could. Then they asked the gardener who helped look after the whole garden, to help too. George got very dirty, with mud all over his hands. But they were ready.

They started by planting lots and lots of trees. George and the gardener collected saplings from a local forest. Gregory carefully helped dig holes with his enormous hands. The gardener tried to tell George about how important it was to make sure the soil had lots of nutrients. Gregory got impatient, which meant the gardener got busy trying to explain everything again! It took many afternoons, many trips to the forest, and the most work that George had ever seen to get everything right. The blue house looked more like a small house, amongst all of the growing trees!

Then, they built a treehouse in the tallest oak tree. George's dad, who was very good with tools, helped. They got special rope, so it would be easier for Gregory to use, too. Gregory was incredibly careful when he climbed up, but George was sure it was quite scary for him to even move so high off the ground. The treehouse was very big and very strong, perfect for a giant gorilla.

Next, they got some banana trees, specially ordered from a nearby nursery. Gregory loved banana trees! He would sit and watch them grow, every day, very patiently. The other trees, George noticed, seemed to grow more slowly, or in places, the way the gardener said they probably wouldn’t, to begin with.

They even built a small pond, filled with water for Gregory to drink and splash in. They thought about fish, but decided it was too dangerous. Fish for humans were great; fish for a big gorilla, probably wouldn’t last long!

As the jungle grew, Gregory’s grumpiness slowly disappeared. He still looked grumpy sometimes, but now George could see that he was just… concentrating! He’d spend his days swinging through the trees, munching on bananas, and splashing in the pond. He and George had regular tea parties, sharing pancakes and reading stories in the treehouse.

One day, George was reading aloud in the treehouse. Gregory was stretched out in a comfy chair, basking in the sunshine that peeked through the green leaves.

"And so," George read, "the hero found his way home…"

Gregory suddenly sat up straight. He seemed unusually excited.

"Home…" he repeated softly.

George looked at him. "Yes, home," he said. "The hero always found his way home, eventually."

Gregory sighed. "But I miss my home, home," he said, more thoughtfully.

George frowned. "But… isn't this your home now, Gregory?" he asked, gesturing around the green, leafy jungle that they'd built together.

Gregory looked around at the lush green trees, the growing banana trees, and the happy smile on George’s face. He looked at the treehouse, their safe place together. He was content; really and truly.
Slowly, a tear trickled down his furry cheek. But this time, it wasn’t a tear of sadness. It was a tear of happiness.

“Yes,” Gregory said, his voice thick with emotion. “Yes, George. This is my home. And you… you are my best friend."

George smiled. He knew that Gregory might still be a giant, grumpy gorilla sometimes. But he also knew that Gregory was, deep down, the kindest, friendliest gorilla in the whole wide world. And together, they lived happily in the garden, in their own very special jungle, for many, many years to come.
