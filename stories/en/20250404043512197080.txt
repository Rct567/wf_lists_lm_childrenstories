<title>The Hippo Who Danced The Tango Very Well.</title><body>
Flora the hippo lived in a swamp, a big, green, and gloriously muddy swamp. Now, most hippos in the swamp were perfectly content with their lives. They enjoyed wallowing in the mud, munching on grass, and occasionally grumbling about the heat. But Flora was different. Flora had a secret. She loved to dance.

Her love began one afternoon when a travelling troupe of flamboyant flamingoes, led by the famously fabulous Fifi, accidentally stumbled upon her swamp. They were practising their tango, their ruffled feathers swirling, their long legs tapping a rhythmic beat. Flora, hidden in the reeds, watched, her heart thumping a curious tango rhythm of its own.

Fifi, noticing Flora’s rapt attention, puffed out her chest, “Well hello there, young hippo! What do you think?”

Flora, usually shy, stammered, "I...I think it's... beautiful!"

“Beautiful, is it?” Fifi winked, her eye sparkling. “It takes more than just beauty, my dear. It takes passion, precision, and a whole lot of practice. Come now, try a step!”

And so, the unlikely partnership began. Fifi, with her dramatic flourishes, taught Flora the basics of the tango. It wasn’t easy. Hippos, you see, are not known for their agility. Flora, being quite large, had some trouble with the fancy footwork.

“One, two, three, pause! Four, five, six, lean!” Fifi would command, flapping her wings.

Flora would wobble, her massive legs sometimes getting tangled in her own feet. "Um... Fifi, I think I'm supposed to lead with my... snout?"

“Nonsense!” Fifi would squawk, adjusting a feather. "You're a magnificent beast! You must feel the music flow through you!"

The other swamp creatures, initially, were rather bemused.

Bertram the bullfrog would croak, “A hippo doing the tango? Preposterous!”

Shelly the snail, who loved observing everything at a snail’s pace, simply commented, “Well, she is certainly… persistent.”

Cecil the crocodile, ever stoic, remained unmoved, occasionally grumbling about the splashing. “Makes a mess, all that dancing."

But Flora, encouraged by Fifi’s unwavering belief, persevered. Days turned into weeks. The mud, often disturbed by Flora’s attempts, took on the sheen of a well-worn dance floor. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, she began to improve. Her steps became smoother, her turns more graceful. She found the rhythm, that fiery pulse of the tango, deep within her.

One sunny morning, Bertram hopped closer, looking slightly less cynical than usual. "You... you're actually getting quite good, Flora," he conceded.

Flora beamed, her eyes shining. "Thank you, Bertram! It's a lot of fun."

"Well, I still don't understand the whole thing," Cecil admitted, "but you’re not splashing quite as much."

Even Shelly, inching forward a millimeter, managed a rare comment. “Impressive.”

Then, the day arrived when Fifi announced, "Flora, my dear, it's time!"

“Time for what?” Flora asked, her stomach fluttering.

"Time to perform, of course! The annual Swamp Festival is next week, and you, my dear, are going to be the star!" Fifi declared.

Flora gasped. “Me? But… the other hippos…”

Fifi chuckled, “They’ll be amazed! Now, let's rehearse!"

The next few days were a flurry of practice. Fifi perfected their routine, tweaking the steps to suit Flora's size and incorporating dramatic pauses that suited the hippo’s personality. They selected a particularly stirring piece of music played by the band of fireflies from the neighboring swamp, and perfected their dips and their leans.

Finally, the day of the festival arrived. The swamp was abuzz with activity. Stalls selling delicious swamp snacks lined the banks, and the air thrummed with music and laughter. The other hippos, led by Hubert, Flora’s cousin, eyed her with a mixture of curiosity and disbelief.

“What are you doing dressed up like that, Flora?” Hubert grumbled, eyeing the shimmering beads Fifi had decorated her with.

Flora, despite her nerves, stood tall. "I'm going to dance, Hubert!"

The stage, a large, slightly wobbly platform of lily pads, was set. Fifi took her place, preening, and the fireflies tuned their tiny instruments. The music began, a passionate, dramatic tango. Fifi stepped onto the stage, elegant and poised. Then, she extended a wing.

And there was Flora.

The crowd gasped. They'd never seen anything like it. Flora, magnificent in her size, but filled with a dancer's grace, walked toward Fifi and, as they began, even Hubert found his jaw hanging open.

“Wow…” he muttered, forgetting his grumbling for a moment.

Flora and Fifi moved together, their partnership now completely polished. The hippo, following the flamingo, did not falter. She knew the steps. She felt the music. She dipped and turned and swept and swayed. The whole swamp, spellbound, watched her dance the tango.

The other creatures forgot their prejudice, their doubts, their grumbles. They watched in a total hush. Even Cecil seemed to have a flicker of appreciation in his normally impassive eyes. Even Shelly moved from her vantage point to a front row viewing spot.

Bertram couldn’t help but clap after a particularly impressive pirouette from Fifi. The whole swamp cheered as they reached the end of their performance!

When the final notes faded, the crowd erupted. Applause thundered across the water. Cheers rang out, echoing through the trees.

“Bravo! Bravo!”

“Encore!”

Flora, beaming and sweating, felt a surge of triumph. She bowed with Fifi, taking a deep breath as the joy of the festival washed over her.

Hubert, clapping harder than anyone else, went to Flora.

"Flora... that was… incredible!" He sounded genuinely amazed.

"I know, Hubert! Wasn’t it great?" Flora gushed back.

Bertram hopped over, his eyes wide. “Flora, that was the most spectacular thing I’ve ever seen! And I eat flies for a living, and I’ve seen a lot of things.”

Cecil even cracked a tiny smile, "Not bad, Flora. Not bad at all. And you didn’t make too much of a splash.”

Shelly, unusually excited, inched forward to compliment her. "Extraordinary performance, dear Flora. A true wonder."

Fifi, radiant, hugged Flora. “See, my dear? I told you you had the talent.”

The following day, back in the muddy swamp, Flora, covered in glittering mud from the day’s performance, and sat near Fifi, watching the sunset. They continued their lessons. And then there was a change in their life, of which Flora has to take the initiative and suggest for the festival in the years that come...

"Fifi," Flora began hesitantly, "It was amazing! That day was more special than I have dreamed! But the fireflies… they must get tired... And they need rest!"

Fifi knew where this was going. The swamp already seemed to adore Flora and the tango. Now, they will all dance every day. Every sunset and sunrise, they will enjoy it! And Flora made Fifi promise that one year, for the festival, they should learn a different dance, as a special performance.

Fifi nodded and smiled. "Absolutely, my dear. Absolutely. We’ll conquer every dance in the world."

And so, the dancing hippo became a legend. The Hippo Who Danced The Tango Very Well. Flora the hippo continued to dance, gracing the swamp with her passion and her talent. She proved that with determination, a good teacher, and a whole lot of mud, anything is possible. And every year, the swamp’s Swamp Festival became even more fabulous, filled with more dancing, laughter, and the joyous rhythm of a dancing hippo.
