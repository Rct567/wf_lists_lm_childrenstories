<title>Penelope's Peculiar Parrot and the Pirate's Lost Treasure Map</title><body>

“Polly want a cracker!” squawked Penelope’s parrot, Percy, perched on the window sill.

“Not now, Percy,” sighed Penelope, sketching a rather wobbly picture of a fluffy sheep. “I'm trying to concentrate.”

Percy tilted his head, a bright blue eye fixed on Penelope. “Concentrate? Treasure! Gold! Buried!”

Penelope dropped her pencil. “Treasure? You’re talking about treasure?”

“Aye, matey!” Percy hopped excitedly. “Captain Bluebeard's treasure! Map! Hidden! In the…” He paused, ruffled his green feathers, and looked around the room. “…In the… uh oh…”

“In the… what, Percy?” Penelope prompted, her heart beginning to race. Captain Bluebeard was the legendary pirate of their island, Whispering Cove, and tales of his hidden treasure were whispered by every child.

Percy squawked again. “The… the…” He squawked again, louder this time. “The… *ticklemonster*!”

Penelope giggled. "You silly bird! There's no ticklemonster!"

“No ticklemonster?” Percy looked utterly crestfallen. “But… the map… it was… with the…” He shuddered dramatically.

“Come on, Percy, focus!” Penelope pleaded, getting more excited. “Where’s the map?”

Percy suddenly perked up. “Clues! Must find clues! First clue… on the… the…” He strained, wriggling his feathers. “On the… **grassy gnome!**”

Penelope burst out laughing. “The grassy gnome? The garden gnome?” They had a chipped garden gnome, slightly moss-covered, perched by their rose bushes.

“Aye!” Percy squawked triumphantly. “Go! Find the clue!”

Penelope raced out of the house, Percy fluttering behind her. They hurried to the gnome. It was indeed on a patch of grass, its painted red hat a little faded.

“Okay, Percy, what do we do?”

Percy landed on the gnome’s head and peered down. “Look under the hat! The clue!”

Penelope cautiously lifted the gnome’s hat. Beneath, neatly folded, was a small piece of parchment.

"It says…" Penelope read aloud, “‘Where the sun kisses the sea, seek the wooden warrior three.’ "

Percy squawked, “The sun! The sea! Wooden warrior!”

Penelope knew exactly what it meant. They had a set of three weather-beaten wooden soldiers standing guard outside the boathouse, overlooking the beach where the sun set in the evening.

They hurried down to the boathouse, the salty sea breeze whipping at Penelope's hair. The wooden soldiers stood, silent sentinels, their painted eyes gazing out at the ocean.

“Where’s the clue, Percy?”

Percy studied the soldiers, his head tilted. “Look… at… the… feet!”

Penelope examined each soldier. Under the feet of the middle soldier, tucked into a crevice in the wooden platform, was another small scroll.

“This one says…” Penelope read, “‘Beneath the watchful eye, where secrets lie, dig deep to touch the sky.’ ”

“The watchful eye!” Percy repeated, flapping his wings. “Where secrets lie!”

This time, Penelope didn't hesitate. She knew what it meant. Across the cove, on the other side of the beach, stood the old lighthouse, with its giant glass eye.

"We're going to the lighthouse!" she declared, already running.

Percy was right behind her, squawking with delight.

The lighthouse was a tall, stone structure, and Penelope knew they had to find a secret, hidden place. They clambered up the winding stairs to the top, where the huge lens sat.

"Where can we look here, Percy?" Penelope panted, breathless.

Percy circled the room, squawking impatiently. “Hmm… secrets… high up… dig… to the sky…” He then let out a loud squawk of excitement and flew to a dusty old chest. “In the chest! Dig in the chest!”

Penelope heaved the heavy lid of the chest open. It was filled with old nautical charts, lanterns, and other odds and ends. She started digging. And then her fingers brushed against something.

"I've found something!" Penelope exclaimed, pulling out a small, brass key. "But where do we use this?"

Percy looked at her, puzzled. “The key… The key to… the old… the **sea chest**!”

They ran back down the stairs, searching the lower levels of the lighthouse for a likely looking chest. And eventually, in a dark storage room, they found it – a battered wooden sea chest.

Penelope fitted the key in the lock and the chest sprung open with a creak. Inside, nestled amongst dusty, yellowed documents, was another rolled-up parchment, thicker than the others.

"This one must be the real treasure map!" Penelope announced excitedly.

Carefully, she unrolled the map. It was a beautiful drawing, filled with details – a depiction of Whispering Cove, marked with landmarks. Crosses were placed on the map.

Percy pointed with his beak. “Cross! Cross! See the… the **salty springs!**”

The Salty Springs was a cluster of small tide pools near the western edge of the beach, where the waves crashed against the rocks. They quickly made their way there. Following the map, Penelope used her small spade to dig at the spot. After a few minutes of digging, her shovel struck something hard.

“I’ve got it!” she cried.

With Percy watching intently, she carefully pulled out a wooden chest, not very big. She opened it, trembling with anticipation.

Inside, nestled on a bed of velvet cloth, was not glittering gold coins or dazzling jewels. Instead, were small, wooden figurines, beautifully carved and painted: A parrot with a feathered cape, a fierce looking pirate with a striped bandanna, a young girl with long braided hair and a determined expression.

“But… they’re just… dolls!” Penelope’s voice was tinged with disappointment.

Percy let out a loud squawk. “No! Not just dolls! *Important dolls*!”

He hopped down, studying them with unusual concentration. He circled the pirate, pecked at the girl's little wooden hands and the pirate's little wooden cutlass. “Look… the… secret…”

Penelope examined the figurines more closely. She noticed that each figurine had a small, intricately carved letter on its base.

"There's a letter on the parrot… a 'P'!" she read.

"On the pirate, it’s a 'B'!" Penelope continued.

“And… on the little girl… it’s an ‘S’!” Penelope exclaimed excitedly.

“P… B… S…” Percy squawked loudly, beating his wings. “Place! The dolls! P…B…S… Place them together!”

Penelope realised that this was their real treasure! PB&S. “My initials! My name! Penelope Blue Smith! This is me and all my adventures! and you Percy, you have got me started on these adventures.”

“Goodness gracious me!” Penelope laughed, suddenly understanding. "This wasn't about gold and jewels, was it?" She realised that she'd found a treasure that was more precious than anything else: the joy of an adventure. She started to carefully put the little wooden figurines in a prominent space on the shelf in the front living room.

Just then, there was a knock at the door.

It was Mrs. Higgins, their neighbour, a rather stern-looking woman. She held a small package.

“Penelope, dear,” she said, her voice surprisingly gentle. “I believe this might be yours. It fell from your pocket earlier today while you were digging."

She handed Penelope a piece of parchment – another treasure map. Penelope was excited, but now she was even more eager.

Penelope carefully smoothed out the paper.

“Let’s find it! Adventure time, Penelope’s time for another treasure, and more of these dolls” Penelope said while Percy was sitting on her shoulder.

Percy tilted his head, and squawked. "Polly want a cracker! And another adventure!"
Penelope and Percy exchanged delighted glances and smiled at each other. The pirate's treasure hadn't contained riches, but it was full of exciting new opportunities and great times! The map seemed to be calling out to her, another quest, another moment to share her time with her dearest friend, Percy.
The next morning, Penelope put the new map that her neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, left in the package.

“Ah ha! Here is the treasure location!” Penelope yelled while laughing.
Penelope and Percy’s adventure never ended. And it wasn't really over. It had just started and they were set to create a whole new set of adventures together.
