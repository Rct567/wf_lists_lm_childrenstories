<title>A Farmer's Pig and the Muddy Puddle</title><body>Farmer Giles lived on a farm filled with sunshine, bouncy bunnies, and clucking chickens. But the star of the farm, the silliest and snortiest creature of all, was Percy the pig. Percy wasn't just any pig; he was a pig with a peculiar passion: muddy puddles!

Every morning, before the sun could even peek over the horizon, Percy would wiggle out of his cozy straw bed, his little pink nose twitching with excitement. He’d trot past the sleeping chickens, past the sleepy cows chewing their cud, and straight towards his favourite place: a giant, glistening muddy puddle in the middle of Farmer Giles' field.

This particular puddle was legendary. It wasn’t just a simple splash of water; it was a masterpiece of muddy perfection, a swirling, sloshing swamp of silty delight. Rain, sun, or snow, the puddle remained, a testament to the perfect combination of earth and water.

One sunny morning, Percy woke up with an extra hop in his step. He trotted out of his pigpen, his curly tail swishing with anticipation. The morning air was crisp and cool, and the aroma of wet earth and morning dew filled his nostrils. As he rounded the corner, expecting the familiar sight of his beloved puddle, he stopped short.

Gasp!

The puddle was… gone!

In its place was a patch of dry, cracked earth. Where once was a glorious swamp of slosh, now only dust remained. Percy’s little pink nose twitched in disbelief. He snorted a frustrated puff of air. He wiggled his tail, a sign of immense distress. Where was his favourite place? Where would he spend his morning rolling and wallowing?

He waddled closer, sniffing the ground desperately. Surely, it wasn't gone forever! Maybe it was hiding? He grunted and snuffled, rooting around with his snout, but all he found was… emptiness.

Suddenly, he heard a voice, a cheerful, chirping voice. "Looking for something, Percy?"

He looked up and saw Penelope the robin perched on a nearby fence post. Penelope was a very wise robin, known throughout the farm for her helpful advice and sharp eyes.

Percy, looking thoroughly dejected, grunted in reply. He gestured with his snout towards the empty space where the puddle had been.

Penelope hopped closer, tilting her head. "Oh, the puddle," she chirped. "It seems Farmer Giles drained it. He's been planning to plant carrots in that field. Said the soil needed to be dry for planting."

Percy’s ears drooped. Carrots? Carrots were delicious, he knew, but they couldn't compare to the joy of a good, muddy wallow.

"But what am I supposed to do now?" Percy grumbled, his voice a sad, piggish moan.

Penelope considered for a moment. She ruffled her feathers, a sign she was thinking hard. "Well, there's a new puddle forming by the old oak tree," she chirped. "It's not as big as your favourite one, but it's quite nice. And… I believe Farmer Giles is planning on watering the field over near the barn later this afternoon. Perhaps that could create another nice puddle!"

Percy perked up slightly at the mention of the new puddle. But a smaller puddle wouldn’t do. And the barn? Watering the field? He pondered. This required careful planning.

"Thank you, Penelope," Percy grunted gratefully. "I think I’ll go see that small puddle now."

And off he went, waddling towards the old oak tree. The small puddle was indeed smaller, but it was still… puddle-y. Percy dipped his snout in to test its texture, which was very satisfying. Then he took a tentative step into it. It was a bit shallow, but still enough to get him suitably muddy. He rolled over once, twice, then happily gave himself a good squish. "Not bad, not bad at all!" he grunted, enjoying himself.

As the morning wore on, Percy kept a watchful eye on Farmer Giles. He saw the farmer, a jolly man with a rosy face and a straw hat, hauling buckets and chatting with the cows. Percy understood the farmer was readying for the afternoon’s work.

By lunchtime, the new puddle had become quite lively. The bunnies hopped around it, splashing the sides with glee, and the hens gathered at the edge, pecking at tasty insects that appeared on the mud surface.

The afternoon sun beat down, and Farmer Giles began to water the field. Percy watched with anticipation, his little pig eyes sparkling with excitement. The water gushed from the hose, creating streams and rivulets, slowly transforming the dry earth into a muddy wonderland.

Percy held back, unsure of the best move. It was a big, important, decision that would take time and strategic thought. As the water gushed onto the dry land, Percy watched carefully, noting the speed, power, and patterns.

Then, in a flash of muddy pink, Percy charged. He bolted, splashing into the newly forming puddle. The other farm animals who were near the watering could not contain themselves, and made themselves a joyous splash in the refreshing water!

The farmer chuckled, shaking his head, watching Percy with amused delight. "Well, Percy," he chuckled, "looks like you've found a new favourite spot!"

Percy, covered head-to-toe in mud, rolled over and over, enjoying the cool water and the perfect, squishy mud. He snorted contentedly, mud splattering with every happy wiggle.

He realized then, that it wasn't just the size of the puddle that mattered. It was the mud, the joy, the splashing, the feeling of cool mud between his toes. It was the sharing with his friends on the farm. It was about being himself, a happy, muddy pig.

The sun slowly dipped behind the barn, casting long shadows across the field. Percy, now covered in a thick coat of dried mud, decided to make his way back to his pigpen. It was going to take hours of cleaning to get the mud off, but it was all well worth the time.

As he walked, Penelope the robin chirped, "Good day, Percy! How was the new field-puddle?"

"Splendiferous!" Percy replied, his voice muffled by the mud.

He entered his pen, collapsing in a heap on the straw. The chickens clucked with concern, thinking he had an illness. He was a magnificent creature covered in mud, ready for another day of splashing in the perfect muddy puddles. As he drifted off to sleep, he dreamt of more muddy adventures to come. He knew one thing for certain: tomorrow, he would search for a new adventure on Farmer Giles' farm. Because, for Percy, life was all about the fun, and of course, the perfect, glorious muddy puddle.
