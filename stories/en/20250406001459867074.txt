<title>Building a Sandcastle with a Friendly Crab by Seaside</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, at a beautiful seaside, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily loved going to the beach. The sand was soft and warm between her toes, the waves sang gentle songs, and the sky was always a bright, happy blue. Lily's favourite thing to do was build sandcastles.

One sunny morning, Lily packed her bright yellow bucket, her sturdy green shovel, and her favourite red beach towel. She skipped down to the beach, her pigtails bouncing. The sea air smelled of salt and sunshine, and the waves were whispering secrets as they tumbled onto the shore.

Lily found a perfect spot, just a little ways from the sparkling water. She smoothed the sand with her hands, and then, with a big smile, she began to dig. “This,” she announced to herself, “will be the most amazing sandcastle ever!”

She dug and dug, making a large, round space. Then, she carefully filled her bucket with wet sand from the edge of the water. She trudged back to her dig site, tipping the bucket over. “Clunk!” The wet sand made a satisfying sound as it plopped onto the growing foundation of her castle.

Lily continued to fill her bucket, feeling the cool water wash over her toes as she gathered sand. Back and forth, back and forth, she went, humming a little tune. As she was filling her bucket for what felt like the tenth time, she noticed something small and crab-shaped scurrying towards her.

It was a crab! A little crab, with a bright red shell and two big, curious eyes. The crab scuttled sideways, its little claws clicking on the sand. It seemed to be watching Lily build her castle with intense interest.

Lily giggled. “Hello there, little crab!” she said softly. The crab stopped, tilted its head slightly, and blinked its eyes. Lily knelt down, offering the crab a small piece of her apple, which she had packed for a snack.

The crab, after a moment's hesitation, scurried forward and took the apple with its claw. Munch, munch, munch. It happily ate the apple piece, and then, with a little click, clicked a small claw at Lily.

“Do you like my sandcastle?” Lily asked the crab. The crab seemed to understand her, turning its tiny body and gesturing with one of its claws towards the pile of sand that Lily had so carefully gathered. It seemed to be saying 'Keep up the great work!'.

Lily smiled and continued building. The crab stayed nearby, watching her. She started to build towers. She carefully patted the sand into the right shape, using her shovel to make the walls tall and sturdy. Each tower got higher, each tower looking grand.

The sun climbed higher in the sky. Lily's face became flushed, and she started to feel a bit tired. "Oh, building a castle is harder work than I thought!" she sighed. She sat back and rested, admiring her progress.

The crab, who had been watching, suddenly started to tap its claw on the sand. Tap, tap, tap. It seemed to be trying to get her attention. Lily looked at the crab with curiosity. “What is it, little crab?” she asked.

The crab scurried closer, and using its tiny claws, began to pull small pebbles and seashells from the beach. It gathered the pebbles in front of the sand castle walls, using the shells as little stepping stones and the pebbles to support the castle's foundations, pointing at Lily's sandcastle in doing so.

Lily's eyes widened. “Oh, you want to help me decorate!” she exclaimed. She knew that the crab wanted to help. She was so happy that her crab friend was helping.

With the crab as her assistant, the work went even quicker! Lily carefully placed the sand in a way the crab advised her to. The crab chose the best spots.

Lily continued working on the castle. First came the towers. She made them tall and wide, sturdy and strong. Then, she started to add the walls. She carefully packed the sand. Then came the battlements on the walls. It was amazing how the little crab knew so much! It made small changes. The castle looked magnificent.

They continued, working side by side. The little crab would select seashells to decorate the castle walls. The crab would put pebbles in carefully placed patterns to add small and beautiful additions. It would gently direct Lily’s bucket of sand.

The crab also found smooth, colourful stones, and Lily placed these in the sand to make a pretty pathway leading up to the castle gates. Together, they transformed the plain sand into a real royal residence.

Lily would show the crab which sand and decorations would look best in each location. The little crab, in return, pointed out which spots required special attention.

They worked in perfect harmony. Lily would make a big pile, and the crab would guide her. "Maybe this seashell should be placed here," the crab would signal with a sideways gesture of a tiny claw.

The sun began to move towards the horizon, painting the sky with warm colours. The air grew cooler, and the gentle waves began to make even more splashing sounds. The sandcastle was almost complete! Lily had never made such a beautiful castle before. The castle seemed alive with character.

The little crab then guided Lily, by clicking with a tiny claw. To finish their masterpiece, they placed a shiny, iridescent seashell on top of the tallest tower. The seashell shimmered and sparkled.

The work was complete!

Lily and the crab looked at their work, the castle glowing in the sunlight. It had strong walls and tall towers. The seashells and the stones shone under the last sunbeams. The little crab was proud.

“Wow!” Lily exclaimed, clapping her hands. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” The crab seemed to agree. It scuttled back and forth in front of the castle, its eyes shining with pride. Lily knew it felt the same way about their shared project.

They had been working so hard, neither of them even realized the tide was creeping closer! It started washing over the sand, tickling their feet. Lily laughed. “The castle is so good. This sea is kind and gentle, it's almost like it doesn't want to touch it."

Lily spent some time there. She took her towel and sat nearby on the warm sand and enjoyed the view. She continued to chat to her crab friend.

Soon, the waves started gently touching the edge of the castle, washing around the smooth stones and colourful shells. Little by little, the sand started dissolving, and with a little help from the tide, the sea made the sand smooth again. It gently took the battlements.

Lily wasn't sad; she knew that every day, sandcastles wash back to the sea.

The crab scurried closer and watched with her, with a little click of its tiny claws. Lily looked at the crab, who was still there. It felt wonderful to be at the beach.

Then the last towers washed away, and only a soft mound of sand remained. The tide washed everything away! The crab just clicked at Lily. It was telling her the castle could have been in their hearts forever!

Lily smiled. “It was so much fun building it with you, little crab!” she said, picking up her bucket and shovel. "Thank you for your help and your beautiful friendship.”

The little crab tapped its claw on the sand once more, as if to say, "You're welcome." Then, it scuttled back into the sea, disappearing amongst the gentle waves.

Lily packed her things and walked home along the beach, her heart full of joy. She knew she would never forget her amazing adventure building a sandcastle with a friendly crab. The memories of their shared afternoon, the bright colours of the seashells and the sun, the way the crab seemed to understand her perfectly – all these things would stay with her, making her happy.

She knew, as she walked home that day, that she would be back on the beach very soon, ready to build another sandcastle, hoping to find her crab friend once more. She hoped to build another sandcastle. And this time, the sandcastle would be an even more amazing sandcastle! Because no matter what happened to the castle, Lily knew one thing for sure.

She knew, in her heart, that she had a very special friend by the seaside. And sometimes, that was all she really needed.
