<title>The Turtle Who Was Always Late</title>
<body>
"Good morning, Tilly!" chirped Shelly the Squirrel, her bushy tail twitching excitedly. "Ready for the Great Meadow Games today?"

Tilly the Turtle blinked slowly. Her shell, a mosaic of earthy browns and greens, was still damp with morning dew. "Morning, Shelly," she mumbled, "Games, you say? Are they starting now?"

Shelly giggled, bouncing on her paws. "Well, no, not exactly *now*. The announcement said they start at sunrise! And sunrise was... well, it was quite a while ago, Tilly!"

Tilly sighed, a little puff of air escaping her nostrils. "Oh dear. Right. Sunrise. I do seem to be running a bit behind."

"A bit?" Shelly tilted her head. "Tilly, you're always late! Remember last week's berry picking contest? You arrived just as the judges were announcing the winners!"

Tilly wriggled her snout. "I know, I know. It's just… things take me a little longer. I'm a turtle, after all!"

"I know you are, Tilly! And we love you! But you miss all the fun!" Shelly’s voice was laced with a gentle concern. "The Great Meadow Games are the highlight of the year! There's the long jump, the seed-spitting contest, the even… well, the snail race! But even *they* might finish before you get there."

Tilly chuckled weakly. The snail race. Now *that* would be a close contest! “Perhaps you're right, Shelly. But what can I do? I can't exactly sprout wings and fly!"

Just then, Barnaby Badger lumbered past, his striped fur gleaming in the sunlight. "Morning, girls! Ready for the games?"

"Morning, Barnaby!" Shelly replied enthusiastically. "We're just encouraging Tilly to hurry! She's always late!"

Barnaby chuckled, a deep rumble in his chest. "Indeed. Tilly, my dear, if you're aiming to win any of the prizes, you’d best get a move on! The first event, the 'Find the Hidden Acorn' competition, starts in half an hour!"

Tilly's eyes widened. "Half an hour! Oh, my goodness! That's practically no time at all!"

"Exactly!" Barnaby winked. "Maybe try waking up a little earlier next time." And with that, he trotted off towards the games area.

"See?" Shelly said. "Half an hour! Come on, Tilly, let’s go! I'll help you. Maybe we can strategize on how to make you faster!"

Tilly looked at her friend, her face softening with gratitude. "Shelly, you're a true friend. Okay, let's give it our best shot. But don't expect miracles!"

Shelly immediately began planning. "Okay, first things first: what makes you slow?"

Tilly thought hard. "Well, everything, really! I have to move slowly, because… well, it's the way I’m built. My legs are short and stumpy, and my shell is heavy. And… I have to eat, of course! A turtle's gotta eat, especially before games!"

"Eating *before* the games is a bad strategy if you are late!" Shelly squealed. "No time for eating now! What else?"

"Hmm… Oh! I get distracted easily. A beautiful flower catches my eye. Or a particularly interesting rock. Or a delicious-looking earthworm…"

Shelly threw her paws in the air. "Distraction is our enemy! Right. Here’s the plan! We’ll have a 'no flower-gazing' rule. No rock admiring. And absolutely NO earthworm searching until the games are over!"

Tilly chuckled, picturing herself ignoring all the beautiful flowers in the meadow. “That will be difficult. But… I shall try!"

"Excellent! And to help you along, I'll act as your guide and reminder!" Shelly declared. "I'll scout ahead, tell you the fastest routes, and gently nudge you to stay on track! And the biggest time saver we can attempt today is going straight to the games first, before getting lost at the wormhole!”

"Lead the way then, Shelly!" Tilly replied, a newfound determination in her voice.

Shelly zipped ahead. "Okay! First, stay low! We don't want to get caught in the tall grass! Second, don't get distracted by the butterflies! And third, focus! Think about the 'Find the Hidden Acorn' competition!"

Tilly followed, carefully placing one slow foot in front of the other. "I'm trying! This feels… different."

"Keep it up, Tilly! Remember what we talked about before - quick, focused steps," Shelly said, peeking back to make sure Tilly stayed on her planned path.

It was harder than Tilly imagined. The sunlight danced through the leaves, painting the meadow in shades of green and gold. A plump bumblebee buzzed past, tempting Tilly to look. And a tiny, perfect ladybug landed on a nearby leaf. It was beautiful.

“Focus, Tilly!” Shelly called from ahead, snapping Tilly out of her momentary trance.

"Right!" Tilly replied, shaking her head. "Focus!" She looked down, determined not to be distracted by the pretty, little things on the route.

Shelly, meanwhile, used her knowledge of the meadow to her advantage. She avoided the long, grassy paths, navigating instead through shorter trails and gaps in the trees. Sometimes, she had to nudge Tilly gently, or even gently pull at Tilly's foot, to keep her from wandering off track.

They encountered some obstacles. A babbling brook, which Tilly slowly and carefully waded across. A patch of slippery mud, which slowed her even further. But with Shelly's encouragement and guidance, they overcame each challenge.

Finally, they arrived at the 'Find the Hidden Acorn' competition just as the first group of competitors were getting ready to search!

Tilly felt a surge of pride. She had actually made it on time! Well… almost. She took a deep breath and noticed Barnaby Badger winking at her. She waddled over to the starting line, where a variety of animals stood ready to go, like Reginald Rabbit, whose speed was legend. She could see his twitching nose already sniffing the meadow.

“Good morning, Tilly!” Reginald Rabbit chirped. "Late as usual, I see!"

"Good morning, Reginald! And... yes," Tilly admitted. "But at least I made it to the start line!"

"Excellent, Tilly," Barnaby chuckled. "Now, remember the rules! You have fifteen minutes to find the hidden acorn. The first to find it wins a prize!"

The starting whistle blew! Reginald Rabbit leaped off, his white tail a blur. Shelly, without a moment’s hesitation, bounded in a different direction. The other contestants scattered.

Tilly took a deep breath. "Now, where would I hide an acorn, if I were an acorn?" she mused.

She slowly surveyed the area, using her experience and remembering the advice of other forest friends about good acorn spots. She spotted a likely spot - a hollow log near the base of an old oak tree. Slowly, she headed towards the log, scanning the ground as she moved.

A few minutes later, Reginald Rabbit zipped back, carrying a small acorn in his mouth. “Found it!” he announced. “That was easy!”

The judges cheered, giving the little rabbit the first prize.

Tilly, still searching, was disappointed. Fifteen minutes had passed, and she hadn’t found anything! But then, just as she was about to give up, she noticed something nestled under a patch of dried leaves. A tiny acorn!

She slowly nudged it with her nose. Success! She’d found one.

She looked up, only to realize the contest was finished. Barnaby and the others were gathering nearby.

"Well, Tilly!" Barnaby said with a chuckle. "Looks like Reginald won, but you still found an acorn! Persistence, my friend! And congratulations, as you beat the other contestant who never even got here."

Tilly beamed. "I did!"

"Now," said Shelly, "next event is… wait for it… the seed-spitting contest! We got this!"

Together, Shelly and Tilly continued to participate in the games. Tilly didn’t win any prizes, but she participated in every contest. She laughed and cheered along with her friends. By the time the sun began to set, painting the sky with vibrant colours, Tilly was exhausted but happy. She had finally caught the sunrise, and also all the joy of the Great Meadow Games.

“I had so much fun today, Shelly," Tilly said as they began the slow walk home.

"I'm glad, Tilly! You were great!" Shelly said, hugging Tilly. "You didn’t miss a single event."

“Well,” Tilly said, winking. "It’s a good thing I had such a speedy guide."

Shelly laughed. “Next year, we'll make it a real win. We'll focus on being quick, fast, and more time for eating. More than that though, being at the games is winning, even if one isn't the quickest turtle around!"

Tilly grinned. "I look forward to it, Shelly. And maybe... just maybe... I'll start practising early! Next year, maybe..." she stopped and paused, her voice drifting off into a yawn. “Maybe… I’ll… actually… win!” And with a happy sigh, Tilly the Turtle waddled on, her shell catching the last golden rays of the sun.
