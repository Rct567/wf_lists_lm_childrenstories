<title>The Zebra Who Loved the Racing Marathon Fun.</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, nestled in the heart of the sprawling African savanna, lived a zebra named Stripes. Stripes wasn't like the other zebras. While they enjoyed grazing on the sweet, green grass and playfully kicking up dust clouds, Stripes had a passion – a burning love – for the annual Great Savannah Racing Marathon.

"Oh, the marathon!" Stripes would sigh, gazing wistfully towards the distant horizon where the race always began. He'd spend hours watching the antelopes, gazelles, and even the occasional cheetah practicing their sprints and endurance runs. He longed to join them, to feel the wind whipping through his stripes, the ground pounding beneath his hooves.

His best friend, a wise old giraffe named Gigi, often found Stripes staring dreamily. "What troubles your mind today, little Stripes?" Gigi would ask, her long neck bending down so she could meet him eye-to-eye.

"Oh, Gigi," Stripes would reply, his voice filled with yearning. "I wish I could run the marathon. I dream about it every night."

Gigi chuckled softly. "You have a beautiful coat, my friend, and a lovely personality. But remember, zebras aren't known for their marathon prowess. Perhaps you could be the best cheerleader, or the most enthusiastic water station assistant?"

Stripes slumped his shoulders. "But I want to run! I know I could do it if I tried."

One afternoon, Stripes was practicing a little jump when he met another character. "Hullo there, what are you doing, Stripes?" a little, brown monkey called Miko questioned him.

"I was trying to jump. I want to become a good runner," Stripes said sadly.

Miko chuckled and began to tell a story: "Did you hear about the tortoise who won a running competition?"

Stripes paused, blinking in confusion, and responded: "A tortoise? Won the race? But how did he win?"

"Through perseverance and strategy. Maybe you should strategise to enhance your physical abilities?"

Stripes' eyes lit up. "You mean, I could maybe build up my running by planning my progress?"

Miko smiled, nodding his head, and replied, "Yes. Maybe this way you could try your best!"

Miko and Stripes, by this point, decided to begin working together.

"Right!" Stripes exclaimed. "We should start now! We can work on getting me ready for the next Great Savannah Racing Marathon. It's still some months away, right?"

"Indeed!" agreed Miko. "Firstly, we need a training plan. Every athlete needs one, right?"

"What's a training plan?" Stripes questioned, bewildered.

Miko took a deep breath. "We'll design it. Let's split it into phases. In the first phase, you run a short distance every day, and we gradually increase it, slowly and safely! Then we would also introduce various speed drills, interval training, and rest days. Oh, but we won't forget about a healthy diet to boost your energy and growth, either!"

Stripes was already picturing his training days. "Wow! This is super exciting!" he beamed.

The next day, Miko and Stripes set off. Stripes started slowly, but every day, they pushed just a little bit harder. He ran longer distances, climbed steeper hills (with Miko spotting him), and practiced quick bursts of speed. They also came across other animals who were interested. The antelopes taught him how to pace himself. The gazelles showed him how to breathe properly. Even the cheetahs, though initially skeptical, offered some tips on quick starts.

"Rest is very important, Stripes. Don't run the same distances or paces every day!" said a cheetah to Stripes.

Stripes listened intently, determined to prove to everyone that he could do it. Miko was a diligent coach, charting Stripes' progress and offering encouragement.

Gigi watched their efforts with a smile. "You see," she remarked one day to a group of grazing elephants, "Stripes is proving that with determination, anything is possible. It is good to pursue your passions!"

Stripes began to change. His muscles grew stronger, his breath deeper, and his stripes seemed to shimmer with a new confidence. He wasn’t just running; he was thriving. His new friends also became part of his crew and the plan, creating even more innovative ideas to aid his marathon running. The zebras of his herd started to see him differently too, no longer mocking his ambition but watching with a quiet pride.

Finally, the day of the Great Savannah Racing Marathon arrived. The atmosphere was electric. Thousands of animals gathered to watch. The sun beat down, the dust swirled, and the anticipation was palpable. Stripes, standing at the starting line, felt a mixture of nerves and excitement.

He saw the familiar faces of Gigi, Miko, the antelopes, gazelles, and even the cheetahs, all cheering him on. He spotted his herd, watching him intently, too. His heart pounded. He remembered Miko's words: "Remember the plan. Breathe. Pace yourself. Enjoy the journey."

The starting horn blared, and the racers were off! The antelopes and gazelles took the lead, their long legs eating up the ground. Stripes started carefully, running at a steady pace, conserving his energy. The wind rushed past his ears, and the sun warmed his coat. He felt good. Very good.

As the race went on, many racers began to drop behind, exhausted by the distance and heat. Stripes kept running, keeping a steady pace and drawing strength from the cheers of the crowd. He felt the surge of competition from all racers nearby. He started running more and more, knowing his chance.

Then Stripes came to a challenging part of the race, a large, steep hill that took a long time to climb. He kept on running, climbing this large hill. Seeing his pace, Miko ran beside him. He had come to encourage his best friend. "Stripes, keep going! Don't you quit now! Remember all the work that you did?" Stripes suddenly found renewed power and encouragement. He climbed as much as he could.

Other racers kept falling off, due to fatigue. Even some of the professional racers who have entered before found it hard to go the full distance!

Finally, he made it to the top! He still had a good number of kilometres, though. He was nearly exhausted and started to think if he was going to drop out from the race! He thought of the support he was getting from his family. His friends. Especially Miko! They were rooting for him. He also remembered what the cheetah told him. He did his best. He kept moving.

Finally, as the race neared the end, he found that he had come to a position of great success. He was in third place! Could he be in the final three? Everyone cheered as Stripes ran through the finish line, his legs burning. It was not an easy competition, but he never gave up, and he got what he was planning for. The crowd erupted in cheers, and Stripes was surrounded by congratulations.

Stripes had finished in the top three, a feat that surprised everyone. He wasn’t just a participant; he was a winner! He was even standing among the fast and trained racers! He was also now the very first Zebra ever to reach top positions in the marathon.

Gigi, with her long neck, bent down to nuzzle Stripes. "You did it, my friend!" she exclaimed proudly. "You proved that with enough dedication and the help of your friends, anything is possible!"

Miko, practically bouncing with excitement, leaped onto Stripes’ back. “You were amazing! Truly, the best!”

The other animals, including the gazelles and antelopes, crowded around, congratulating him and celebrating his achievement. Even the cheetahs gave him a respectful nod.

Stripes, exhausted but exhilarated, stood tall. He had shown the world – and, more importantly, himself – that even a zebra could achieve the seemingly impossible. His stripes, usually just decorative, now represented his hard work and dedication. He had not just run the marathon; he had inspired everyone! From that day on, Stripes wasn't just known as the zebra who loved the Great Savannah Racing Marathon. He was known as the zebra who won, and he always continued to dream.
