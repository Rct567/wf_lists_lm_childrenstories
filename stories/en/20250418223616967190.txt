<title>A Visit to a Land Filled with Marshmallows</title><body>

Once upon a time, nestled between the Whispering Woods and the Giggling Gorge, lived a little girl named Lily. Lily wasn’t like other children. While they spent their days playing with toys or running in sunlit meadows, Lily spent her days… missing.

She missed her grandmother.

Grandma Elsie had been a warm, bright presence in Lily's life, a beacon of sunshine in every day. She told the best stories, baked the fluffiest cookies, and her laughter, like wind chimes, filled their little house with joy. But Grandma Elsie had gone away. She’d fallen asleep one peaceful evening, and when she awoke, she was no longer in their cozy cottage. She was… elsewhere. Lily's parents said she was “gone”, a word Lily found too small and unsatisfying to hold such a big feeling.

Lily missed her grandmother's warm hugs, the way her eyes twinkled when she told jokes, and the comforting scent of lavender that always clung to her sweaters. The house felt empty without Grandma Elsie's gentle humming and the sweet smell of cinnamon that always filled the kitchen on Saturday mornings.

One particularly gloomy afternoon, rain pattered against the windowpane, mirroring the quiet tears that streamed down Lily's cheeks. She sat by the window, hugging a faded photograph of her and Grandma Elsie, both of them grinning, surrounded by balloons at Lily’s fifth birthday party. Suddenly, a shimmering light filled the room, dancing in the rain-streaked glass.

Lily, startled, blinked and looked up. Before her, the air rippled and warped, and a swirling vortex of colours, like melted rainbow sherbet, appeared in the middle of her room. Hesitantly, Lily reached out a hand, her fingers brushing against the cool, silky surface of the portal.

A voice, soft as a whisper, seemed to emanate from the colours. "Come... find me..."

Lily, forgetting her fear and her sadness, knew instantly that this was a message. A message from Grandma Elsie. With a gulp and a surge of courage, she stepped through the shimmering doorway.

She found herself standing in a landscape unlike any she had ever imagined. The ground wasn't earth, but a soft, spongy bed of white… marshmallows! Gigantic, fluffy marshmallows stretched as far as the eye could see, punctuated by brightly coloured lollipop trees that swayed gently in a breeze that smelled of warm vanilla. Tiny, chocolate rivers flowed through the marshmallow landscape, gurgling and splashing merrily.

Lily gasped. Everything was sweet and inviting. She took a tentative step, sinking slightly into the marshmallowy ground. It felt like walking on clouds.

As she walked, she noticed other extraordinary things. Sparkling sugar-plum bushes dotted the landscape, and fluffy, pink sheep with cotton-candy coats grazed peacefully. Butterscotch birds chirped melodious tunes from branches made of spun sugar, and rainbow butterflies, with wings of hardened caramel, fluttered in the air.

She walked for what felt like a long time, following a shimmering trail of sparkling stardust that appeared to be leading somewhere. As she walked, the marshmallows started to change. They weren't just white anymore. They started to swirl with colour, forming a path lined with lemon-yellow, strawberry-pink, and blueberry-blue. Each marshmallow seemed to have a different flavour and Lily found herself craving a bite, yet somehow, knew she wasn't supposed to eat any.

Eventually, the path led her to a clearing. In the centre stood a small, gingerbread house, smoke curling gently from its chimney, smelling of ginger and spice. As she approached, the door opened, and out stepped… a fluffy, marshmallow bunny, wearing a tiny, red bow tie.

The bunny hopped towards her, his eyes, made of dark chocolate chips, twinkling. "Welcome, little one!" he squeaked, his voice surprisingly deep. "Grandma Elsie has been waiting."

Lily's heart leaped with a mixture of joy and fear. She knew this was it. She followed the marshmallow bunny into the gingerbread house.

Inside, the walls were made of gingerbread, the floor was paved with peppermint candies, and the furniture was fashioned from sugared plums. And there, sitting by a cozy fireplace, was her grandmother.

Grandma Elsie, radiant and smiling, looked younger than Lily remembered. She wore a flowing dress made of starlight and her hair, once silver, now shimmered with golden highlights. She beckoned Lily closer with a warm, welcoming gesture.

Lily ran to her, throwing her arms around her. The feeling of being held by Grandma Elsie, even here, in this strange land, was indescribably comforting. She nestled her head into Grandma Elsie's chest, inhaling the familiar scent of lavender and… marshmallows!

"Oh, Grandma Elsie," Lily cried, her voice muffled. "I missed you so much!"

Grandma Elsie stroked her hair gently. "I missed you too, my sweet girl. More than you can imagine." She held Lily's face in her hands, her eyes sparkling with a love that seemed to fill the entire gingerbread house. "This," she gestured around them, "is a place built on love, memories, and sweet dreams. It is where I live now."

Lily looked around, her gaze wide with wonder. "It's... amazing!"

Grandma Elsie smiled. "It is a place where everything is made of the things you love the most. It's a happy place, Lily, and that’s all that truly matters.”

Lily spent what felt like forever with Grandma Elsie. They talked, they laughed, they reminisced about their favourite memories. Grandma Elsie told Lily about the amazing adventures she'd been having, flying amongst the candy clouds and dancing with the sugarplum fairies. They drank hot chocolate made with melted marshmallows, and Grandma Elsie even showed Lily how to create marshmallow sculptures that would then morph into other delights such as chocolate mountains. They built forts out of giant marshmallows, told stories, and sang songs until Lily’s cheeks ached from laughing so much. She felt a joy she hadn't felt since her grandmother left.

As time went on, Lily could feel a subtle shift; a feeling she had to return home.

"Lily," Grandma Elsie said softly one day, "it's time for you to go back."

Lily’s heart sank. The joy of the land of marshmallows, and being reunited with Grandma Elsie was quickly overtaken by fear. She didn't want to leave. She didn't want to go back to an empty house and a world where Grandma Elsie wasn't.

"But I don't want to," she whimpered, tears welling up in her eyes.

Grandma Elsie pulled her close, stroking her hair again. "My darling girl," she said gently. "I am always with you. You carry me in your heart, and in your memories. This place, this wonderful Land of Marshmallows, is a beautiful thing. I do love it here, and I’ll be forever here but it isn't your place, not yet.”

“This land,” Grandma Elsie continued “was created to remind you that my love will never vanish. It is a symbol of happy thoughts. Every time you think of a memory, of me, you are always with me, and me with you."

Lily still cried. She was scared. She clutched at her grandmother's hand. "But I’ll miss you, Grandma."

Grandma Elsie squeezed her hand. "And I will miss you. But missing someone doesn’t mean you aren’t still connected. Missing someone shows how important they were to you, the memories that bind you will forever remain."

She led Lily back to the shimmering portal, now looking as beautiful and tempting as ever. Grandma Elsie hugged her one last time, the embrace filled with the warmth and comfort Lily so craved.

"Remember," Grandma Elsie said, her voice full of love, "the world might be different, and you might feel lost sometimes, but you're strong, Lily. Remember our happy times, smile, find those joyous moments. Find the sweet inside."

Before Lily could reply, Grandma Elsie gently pushed her towards the shimmering portal. The rainbow colours swirled and shimmered, and the sweet scent of marshmallows filled the air. "Now, my sweet, go, and remember that I love you.”

Lily stepped through the portal.

She was back in her room. The rain outside had stopped, and a weak ray of sunlight peeked through the clouds. She clutched the faded photograph of her and Grandma Elsie. The room no longer felt so empty.

She realised that although her time with Grandma Elsie had ended, her heart, the memories that filled it, and the lessons that have been learned, will always remain.

She took a deep breath, smiled at the faded photograph, and started to build a fort made of her favourite stuffed animals. As she built, she thought about all of the wonderful memories that she shared with her grandmother, and found that the sad feelings started to lift.

Lily, with her new understanding and acceptance of the loss she had, found that happiness and light had entered back in her life again, in new ways. She knew, without a doubt, that although her grandma was gone, their love would always remain, and in remembering the warmth and sweetness of her memories, Grandma Elsie was truly still there with her, within the Land Filled with Marshmallows in her heart.
And from that day on, even on the greyest of days, Lily knew that she carried her grandmother's love with her, a warmth as sweet as a marshmallow, always within her.
