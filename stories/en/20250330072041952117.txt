<title>The Cerberus Who Showed Loyalty to One Person.</title>
<body>
"Woof!" barked a tiny, fluffy puppy, bouncing with uncontained energy.

"Oh, Barnaby, you are *too* excited," sighed a little girl with bright, curious eyes and pigtails the color of sunshine. She gently patted the puppy's head. "We’re just going to visit Grandpa George. It's not like we're going to the Land of Giant Biscuits... though that *would* be exciting, wouldn't it?"

"Woof! Ruff!" Barnaby responded, his tail a blur. He seemed to disagree. Maybe he knew something Lily didn’t.

Lily, whose real name was Lilliana, had a vivid imagination. She believed in everything from talking squirrels to mermaids sunbathing on fluffy clouds. She knew, deep down, that the Land of Giant Biscuits *did* exist. She just hadn't figured out the exact path yet.

As they approached Grandpa George's cottage, nestled at the edge of Whispering Woods, Lily skipped ahead. The cottage was charming, with a crooked chimney and a rose bush that always seemed to be in bloom, even in winter. Barnaby, in his boundless enthusiasm, zoomed around her, tripping over his own paws a couple of times.

The front door creaked open, and a kindly, old face appeared. Grandpa George’s eyes twinkled like the stars Lily saw at night.

"Well, hello there, my sweet pea and you, my bouncy, furry friend!" he boomed, his voice as warm and comforting as a mug of hot chocolate on a cold day. "Come on in, both of you. I’ve baked some cookies!"

Inside, the cottage was filled with the delicious aroma of freshly baked cookies and the comforting scent of old books. Grandpa George led them into the cozy living room, where a crackling fire danced merrily in the fireplace.

"Cookies for my best girl and... for you too, Barnaby, once you've calmed down a bit," Grandpa George chuckled, offering Lily a plate piled high with chocolate chip cookies.

Barnaby, surprisingly, settled down, watching Lily eat with hopeful eyes. He managed a tiny, silent whine.

"Alright, alright," Grandpa George said with a smile. "One cookie for the good boy." He broke a cookie in half and gave Barnaby a piece, who munched it down in one delighted gulp.

After cookies and some imaginative story-telling, the topic drifted to the history books. Grandpa George was known for his knowledge on all things historic.
“Tell me a story!” demanded Lily.

"Hmm," mused Grandpa George. "How about a story about loyalty? A very, very long time ago…" He paused, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "There was a magnificent creature..."

"Ooh, a monster!" Lily squealed with delight.

"Well, yes, in a way. A monster of sorts," Grandpa George conceded, "but also the most loyal creature you could ever imagine. It was a Cerberus."

Lily's eyes widened. "A... a Cerberus?"

"Indeed. The guardian of the Underworld," Grandpa George said solemnly. "A fearsome dog with three heads, guarding the entrance to the land of the dead. He was supposed to be cruel and unyielding, keeping everyone in."

Barnaby, his ears perked up, started wagging his tail as if sensing that he needed to pay more attention to the tale.

“But," Grandpa George continued, leaning closer. "This Cerberus, his name was Hades... well, not really, he wasn't given that name. He only acted that way for a long while. He wasn't cruel at all. He showed kindness... to a single soul. A girl."

"A girl?" Lily repeated, utterly fascinated.

"Yes. The story goes that a young girl named Anya stumbled upon the Underworld's entrance by accident, or some cruel quirk of fate." Grandpa George rubbed his chin, thinking of the tale. "Terrified, she was captured and brought before Hades, the beastly guard."

Lily shivered. "Oh dear."

"But instead of doing the worst, as Cerberuses were thought to do, Hades decided that the girl should not be judged by her fate."

"How can that be?" she asked, bewildered.

"Hades was also cursed," said Grandpa George. "He felt he needed to be hated, so that nothing else of what he truly wanted to do should get done. He was condemned to guard the Underworld with no purpose other than the fulfillment of what he considered to be his life sentence. He couldn't choose to escape, and had no purpose to seek redemption."

"And how does that help Anya?" she asked.

"Hades listened as she made friends," Grandpa George explained. "They would sit outside his gate in silence, and he would hear her singing melodies to help ease her fears. And then the songs got closer to him as she got more comfortable. He let her share her words with him, and soon, all other words seemed to fade away in comparison."

Lily’s eyes sparkled. “So he became her friend?”

“Yes," Grandpa George agreed. "Hades began to learn. He realized she had many friends in her own time, who wanted her to have some reprieve from death. When others entered the Underworld, Hades was harsh and stern, scaring everyone away to prove how dedicated he was to guarding everyone from freedom."

"But with Anya…" Lily prompted.

"But with Anya, he always let her travel back up to the world of the living," said Grandpa George. "No one knew, since Hades seemed so menacing that no one ever inquired. Every time she went back, she spoke of her friends, their families, their problems and joy... All of it, as if she was an equal of a kind guard."

Lily giggled. “A Cerberus letting a girl go back up?"

"That is what I was told when I was a little boy," Grandpa George replied with a wink. "Until she wasn’t able to ever return anymore. As it turns out, people can’t visit the world of the dead whenever they desire."

"Oh no!" Lily gasped, her face falling.

“Yes! A true shame,” Grandpa George agreed, pausing the narration and giving Lily a stern look. “Though with what had happened previously, Anya found joy. The same kind of joy Hades heard from his place at the entrance to the Underworld. Despite what it may sound like to you, that little time together did change them for the better. Anya gave Hades a purpose beyond being a mere guardian."

Barnaby whined.

"Do not worry," Grandpa George reassured Barnaby, noticing his sadness, "the story gets to its important part now! But first," he got up and moved around the kitchen.

"What is it?" Lily asked.

"A bit of fresh ginger tea, I think."

Lily sat patiently. Grandpa George brought the tea. "Anya learned that even the scariest of monsters could be filled with something beautiful on the inside." He sipped at his tea with pleasure. "And Hades… he learned that loyalty wasn't just about guarding a gate. It was about caring for the well-being of someone dear."

"So the Cerberus was good?" Lily confirmed, beaming.

"He showed kindness to a single person. And the single person brought a new sense of wonder in a cruel world to the big monster," Grandpa George affirmed.

Lily took a long sip of her ginger tea, thoughtfully.

"Did he ever get to see her again?" she eventually asked, leaning against her Grandpa George.

Grandpa George shook his head sadly. "No, my dear. He kept the entrance sealed, though. She stayed dead forever. She became immortalized as something of beauty."

"Did she never forget him?" Lily asked with big eyes.

Grandpa George looked down. "I never knew for sure, but every soul the Cerberus greeted after her always looked like it still loved and cared about Anya."

Lily beamed again. "And he loved her?"

"He treasured every moment they shared, as she was something wonderful," he agreed. "Her time made him care about others and allowed him to love more easily."

Barnaby gave a yelp, then whined and turned to lick his feet, hoping that it was all a dream.

"See, Barnaby, some monsters have better purposes than all others, to make their friends feel a sense of safety and happiness," Grandpa George chuckled, and pet Barnaby.

"What happened to him after? Hades?" asked Lily.

Grandpa George sat by the fireplace again, staring into the fire, his gaze drifting toward the ceiling, and the many stories that may still remain: “He stood guarding the gate. Waiting. Hoping for Anya. As if the world had a bit more color when he had a friend.”

“That’s sad,” Lily stated solemnly.

“Perhaps," said Grandpa George. "But it is also beautiful, as he lived on. The Cerberus chose to embrace that moment he had with her, while other stories would not have given the beast such care.”

Barnaby nuzzled Lily’s leg, sensing her sadness.

"Did he ever change his mind and let people go?" asked Lily.

"No, my dear. That was not how it went. As much as it was beautiful to see and share with those you care about, even in her death, the people needed to stay on their designated route. If a girl could be saved in one moment, then perhaps others could see him for what he was meant to be.”

"So even the guardian was doomed to be a monster, even if he wasn’t meant to be?"

“Sometimes, yes," said Grandpa George, a thoughtful tone in his voice. "But the Cerberus showed that loyalty, once given, could be as brilliant as a star."

Lily closed her eyes, picturing the enormous, three-headed dog guarding the Underworld, a single act of friendship making it worth its unending toil. A smile crept across her face.

"Thank you, Grandpa George," she said, giving him a big hug. "That was the best story ever."

"Woof!" agreed Barnaby, happily, and wagged his tail as though it was a flag on parade. Perhaps he understood something of the story, too. Perhaps he recognized the enduring power of love and devotion, the type that had even softened the heart of a terrifying Cerberus.

Grandpa George smiled. "You're welcome, my sweet pea." And as the fire crackled and the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, he knew the story of the Cerberus, and his unending dedication to a single, dear soul, would continue to inspire Lily, in the Land of Giant Biscuits, and everywhere else her imagination might take her.

And as Lily went outside to play in the sunset, so did Barnaby. He may have been tiny and fluffy, but inside of him was a lot of power too.
