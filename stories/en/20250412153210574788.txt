<title>The Big Oak Tree and the Little Ones Loving Him.</title>

“Look, Pip! Up there!” squeaked Rosie, her voice a tiny chirp against the vastness of the morning.

Pip, her brother, barely blinked, his tiny snout twitching. "What, Rosie? Another fluffy cloud that looks like a giant cotton ball?" He was already halfway through gathering shiny acorns for breakfast.

Rosie giggled, a sound like rustling leaves. "No, Silly! Higher! Past the clouds!"

Pip tilted his head back, his tiny eyes trying to follow her pointed paw. There, towering over the whispering meadow and the babbling brook, was their home: The Big Oak Tree. It was a titan of green, a majestic giant that had stood sentinel for centuries. Its gnarled branches reached towards the sky like welcoming arms, and its vast canopy provided shade for the meadow's creatures and home for the little ones.

"Oh," said Pip, a hint of awe in his voice. "You mean The Great One?"

Rosie nodded enthusiastically. "He looks extra magnificent today, doesn’t he? The sunshine makes his leaves shimmer like emeralds!"

"He always looks magnificent," Pip grumbled, though his eyes, too, were admiring the view.

“He does!” Rosie agreed, suddenly remembering the acorns, her own stomach starting to rumble. "Come on, slowpoke! Let’s gather enough acorns for us and Grandmama and Grandpapa too!"

And so, the two little squirrels scurried about, their tiny claws pattering on the fallen leaves. They collected the plumpest, shiniest acorns, carefully placing them in their cheek pouches. They worked quickly, for squirrels are diligent and need to prepare. They gathered for the winter.

“Do you think The Great One ever gets lonely, Pip?” Rosie asked, pausing from her work and peering up at the massive tree.

Pip looked up and considered the question, he, who’s known nothing other than the oak, since he was born. "Lonely? I don't know, Rosie. He’s always surrounded by the wind and the birds and us, isn't he?"

Rosie chewed on a small nut. "Yes, but… doesn't he wish he could *talk* to someone, like us? Or… hug them?”

Pip shook his head. "The wind whispers to him, Rosie. And the birds sing to him. He hears everything." He paused. "Besides, we hug him all the time, in our own way.”

Rosie tilted her head in curiosity. "How do we hug him?"

Pip puffed out his chest. "We live here! We climb on him! We run on his branches! We burrow in his roots! That’s a big hug!”

Rosie giggled again, satisfied. "You're right! It *is*! We're lucky to have The Great One, aren't we?"

“The best!" Pip declared, thumping his tail on the leaf-strewn ground. "Now, more acorns! I'm starving!"

As the weeks passed, the seasons changed, and the little squirrels, as they did with their grandparents, continued their tasks, their devotion, and their conversation. Autumn arrived, painting the Big Oak Tree in hues of red, gold, and orange. The wind, a blustery fellow now, howled through the branches, sending leaves dancing to the ground.

"Brrr! It's getting cold!" Rosie shivered, snuggling close to Pip, both buried in their nest within a cozy knothole high in the oak’s embrace.

“We need to make sure Grandmama and Grandpapa have plenty of acorns to get through the winter," Pip said. "And… make sure The Great One is alright. I saw a little crack in his bark earlier. Perhaps we should alert The Woodpeckers."

They looked at each other, and they knew that they have duties in their lives, not only fun. After they eat and prepare for the winter, their attention now had to be towards the tree's well-being. The Big Oak Tree was not only home to them.

“A good idea!” Rosie exclaimed.

Together, they scampered down the trunk, their tiny claws clinging to the rough bark. They found the woodpeckers, busy with their own preparations, pecking furiously at a nearby branch.

“Mr. and Mrs. Woodpecker!” Pip called, his voice echoing in the woods. “We need your help!”

Mr. Woodpecker paused, his beady eyes narrowed. "Help? With what, little ones? We're quite occupied with our own winter arrangements."

“There’s a small crack on The Great One’s bark," Rosie explained. "We thought you could…well, you could… patch it up!"

Mrs. Woodpecker cocked her head. "A crack, you say? That’s never a good sign.” She peered at her husband. "Come, Samuel. Let’s investigate.”

The woodpeckers flew with the two squirrels toward the oak tree, their sharp eyes scanning the trunk. After careful examination, they began their work, hammering away with their powerful beaks.

Meanwhile, the squirrels, with their work done and attention to their family's situation turned to other things, continued their efforts of getting the home ready for winter.

The winter came and they did not know of hardship, for the tree had supported them the whole time, but they also learned the value of teamwork as time passed.

Later that winter, during a fierce blizzard, Pip awoke to a strange groaning sound.

“Rosie! Wake up!” he whispered, nudging his sister with his nose. “Do you hear that?”

Rosie opened her eyes, her fur ruffled from sleep. “What is it, Pip?”

The groaning continued, a deep, unsettling sound. They peeked out of their knothole and gasped. The Big Oak Tree, its branches laden with heavy snow, was bending. Its very body was strained.

"Oh, no!" Rosie cried. “He’s struggling!”

“The snow is too heavy,” Pip said worriedly, even though his grandfather, who has seen all the seasons, warned him not to worry because nature is built of many things.

Quickly, they raced out of the knothole and down the tree, battling the wind and the snow. They darted across the meadow towards their animal neighbors’ homes.

“Everyone! Everyone! The Great One needs help!” Pip shouted as he approached a family of voles, who had barely managed to get a bit of acorns to start.

“The Great One needs help! He's bending!” Rosie repeated, running into a burrow with a bad of badgers, trying to find the alpha in hopes of calling for aid, even if just help for a few moments.

One by one, creatures of the meadow emerged from their homes. The voles, the badgers, the rabbits, even the usually solitary fox. They all gathered around the Big Oak Tree.

Together, they began to clear the snow from the branches. The voles and squirrels worked their small claws to remove any possible obstructions, while the rabbits helped gather nearby leaves. The badgers pushed any excess snow as best they could to the grounds and clear any obstruction. The fox took the role of leading and guided everyone's actions.

They worked through the bitter cold, their hearts filled with concern for their home. The work was dangerous, and slow but the collective and cooperative efforts from these little creatures slowly eased The Great One’s burden.

At last, after what seemed like hours, the snow began to lighten up from the branches. The groaning ceased. The Big Oak Tree stood tall again, its trunk and branches straining to not move as much.

The creatures, shivering and exhausted, looked at each other. A cheer, hushed and reverent, went through the assembly.

Then they all came up close. Pip and Rosie felt the love and adoration as the Great One.

From that day forward, the animals had a even greater love and compassion to the Big Oak Tree. It was home. It was protection. It was even more so: a family.

When Spring finally arrived, they came to see The Great One when they were together once again. The sun's rays began to tickle and touch The Great One once more. It came from an especially great warmth.

"It felt lonely, that day," Rosie mentioned after watching everyone.

Pip remembered what Rosie asked a while back and agreed with her. It certainly felt empty on that day as the creatures feared of its collapsing and falling down with no one nearby.

"But not anymore, Rosie," Pip answered. "Now we know, even if it can't hug anyone directly, it is being supported by so many, because… he loves us all too!"

And the creatures cheered, for their beloved great home, and to each other. And in the following days they continued to gather for love. They continue to provide safety to one another.

The Big Oak Tree stood strong and majestic, its branches whispering secrets to the wind, secrets of love, companionship, and the enduring power of those who care for each other.
