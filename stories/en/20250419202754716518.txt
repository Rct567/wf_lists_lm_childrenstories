<title>Leo's Lost Lunch and Its Mystery</title>
<body>
Leo the lion was, to put it mildly, a bit of a worrier. Not about hunting, oh no. He was the fiercest roarer in the whole savanna! No, Leo worried about things like… his lunch. And on this particular Tuesday, Leo’s lunch was missing. Poof! Vanished! Kaput!

Leo had packed the most magnificent lunch ever that morning. He'd had a breakfast of crispy grubs, just to fuel up his grumbly tummy for the main event. And what was that event, you ask? A super sandwich! It wasn't just *any* sandwich. This was a 'Roar-some Roast Beef Bonanza' – layers of juicy roast beef, tangy pickle slices, a smear of fiery mustard, and crunchy lettuce all nestled between two fluffy, freshly baked, sesame seed buns. He’d even packed a little carrot for a nibble and a carton of strawberry juice, his absolute favourite.

Leo had placed his glorious lunch, safely tucked away in a bright orange picnic basket, under the shade of the biggest baobab tree. Then, he'd skipped off to the watering hole for a quick, refreshing splash. Just a quick one! He’d only been gone for five minutes!

Now, he was back, and his basket was… empty. The orange basket gaped at him like a hungry hippopotamus's mouth. The Roar-some Roast Beef Bonanza, the crunchy carrot, and the strawberry juice – all gone!

Leo's mane bristled with worry. He paced back and forth, his tail swishing nervously. "This is terrible!" he exclaimed, his voice cracking. "My lunch! Stolen! But… by whom?"

He scanned the surroundings, his golden eyes narrowed. The playful zebras were munching peacefully on grass, their black and white stripes a calming pattern against the green. No suspect zebras. The sneaky monkeys were swinging through the trees, chattering away, but they seemed to be eating nothing more exciting than bananas. No suspect monkeys. The grumpy warthogs were wallowing in mud, oblivious to everything. Definitely no suspect warthogs (they much preferred roots, anyway).

"This is a mystery!" Leo declared, his voice echoing across the savanna. "A lunchtime larceny! I must find the culprit!"

He decided to become a detective. Leo, the Lunch-Larceny-Locating Lion! He donned his invisible magnifying glass (which he pretended to have, because he’d misplaced the real one), and began his investigation.

First, he interviewed the zebras. "Did you see anything suspicious?" he asked, trying to sound stern.

The zebras, chewing their grass contentedly, just flicked their tails. "Nope," said one. "Just saw a grumpy lion missing his lunch. Did someone steal your sandwiches again, Leo?"

Leo puffed out his cheeks, a tell-tale sign of frustration. "It’s a sensitive case, thank you very much!”

Next, he interrogated the monkeys. "Did you see anyone carrying a bright orange picnic basket?" he asked, peering suspiciously up at them.

The monkeys shrieked with laughter. "We saw lots of things, Leo!" chattered one. "But picnic baskets? We only like bananas, silly!"

Leo sighed. This detective work was harder than he thought. He examined the ground. He looked for footprints, clues, any indication of the lunch thief. He noticed a trail of… something. Tiny crumbs. Red crumbs.

"Aha!" he roared triumphantly. "Clue number one! Red crumbs… must be related to… something red…"

He followed the trail of red crumbs. They led him past a snoozing giraffe, who, with a yawn, claimed to have seen absolutely nothing, not even a particularly large sandwich. The crumbs then went past the warthogs, still happily wallowing. They led him past a group of chattering baboons, who denied all knowledge, declaring their complete lack of interest in roast beef.

Finally, the crumb trail stopped. At the bottom of the biggest termite mound in the whole savanna.

"A termite mound!" Leo exclaimed, his brow furrowed. "What connection could this have to the missing lunch? Termites eat wood, not… roast beef!"

He circled the mound, sniffing. He sniffed harder. He sniffed REALLY hard. Suddenly, a tiny termite, much bolder than the others, crawled out.

"Excuse me, Mr. Lion," squeaked the termite. "Are you perhaps looking for something?"

Leo stared at the termite. "Yes! My lunch! The Roast Beef Bonanza! The strawberry juice! The… the… carrot!"

The termite’s tiny antennae twitched. "Oh," it said sheepishly. "About that… you see… we have a bit of a… crumb problem…"

Leo raised an eyebrow. A crumb problem? What did this mean?

“You see, Mr. Lion,” the termite explained, "those crumbs… were… were… us. We were having a little snack party!"

Leo was baffled. A snack party? With his lunch?

“And the carrot?” he demanded. “The strawberry juice?”

The termite fidgeted. "Well," it continued, "the juice was a bit tricky. The crumbs we managed okay. We weren’t expecting that much juice! But, the carrot… we didn’t care for carrots. So it got… left behind…”

Slowly, Leo pieced the puzzle together. The termites, being tiny but very, very industrious, had, somehow, found their way into his picnic basket. They hadn’t stolen the whole lunch, oh no, they’d just… taken a bit of the… crumb. The crumbs, being, well, crummy, had been left behind, leading him on a wild-goose chase!

He sighed, a great, big, lion-sized sigh. This was both a relief and… slightly annoying. His lunch was partly eaten by termites! He looked at the orange picnic basket. It looked particularly innocent and guilty all at the same time.

“So, you mean… most of my Roast Beef Bonanza is inside your mound?” he asked, trying not to sound cross.

“Well, a significant… portion… yes,” admitted the termite.

Leo, after considering it for a moment, made a decision. He was hungry. The day was hot. There wasn’t much point in dwelling on a problem he couldn’t solve.

"Right," he said. "This is what we're going to do." He looked at the termite and its termite colleagues gathered around. “You know what, I had enough for two meals. Would you care for a tiny slice each?"

The termites cheered. Leo took a deep breath and reached into the mostly-empty basket and grabbed what was left of his magnificent sandwich. He very delicately offered tiny pieces of roast beef to the termites, who, with their minute jaws, were exceedingly grateful.

He sat there, surrounded by tiny, crumb-loving termites, nibbling at the remains of his lunch. It was probably the strangest lunch he’d ever had. He also realized that what little bit of juice there was left would barely get through the tiny little bodies.

He realised, though, that, surprisingly, it was not half bad to share and to have friends. The adventure was worth more than lunch. He would eat a lion-sized dinner tonight instead.

“You know,” Leo said finally, wiping a bit of mustard from his whisker, “I guess you little guys like roast beef. Well, now I know. We'll do it again sometime - but this time, perhaps a lunch with everyone in mind?” He looked around. It sounded good, he thought, though maybe a bit silly to say aloud.

The termites, tiny but full of happiness, cheered again.

Leo, the once worried lion, smiled. He still liked his lunch. But he liked having new friends even more. From that day on, Leo always made sure to pack an extra sandwich. Just in case the termites were hungry again. He was always prepared now - and, in fact, he never really misplaced his lunch after that - and it turned out that, every Tuesday, under the biggest baobab tree, the termites, and Leo, enjoyed a roast beef picnic, a little bit friendlier than the week before. The mystery was solved, the culprit… well, friendly. The End.
