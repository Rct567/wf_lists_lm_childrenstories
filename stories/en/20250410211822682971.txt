<title>Making Friends with a Funny Monster</title><body>Lily loved Tuesdays. Tuesdays meant one thing: Library Day! She’d skip and twirl all the way to the big, red-brick building with the giant, golden-lettered sign that read “The Willow Creek Library.”

Lily wasn’t much of a fan of other days. Mondays were a bit of a gloomy grey because the weekend was over. Wednesdays were a rush, trying to get everything done. Thursdays were okay. Fridays were the almost-weekend, so that was a good day. Saturdays and Sundays, those were great – full of playing and adventures! But Tuesdays... Tuesdays held the promise of a whole world between the pages of a book.

She particularly liked the children’s section. It was a cosy corner, with low, brightly painted shelves bursting with colourful covers. Soft, squishy beanbag chairs were scattered about, perfect for curling up and getting lost in a story. The librarian, Mrs. Higgins, always had a welcoming smile and a gentle hand to guide her towards new authors and interesting adventures.

One Tuesday, as she browsed the "Fantasy Friends" shelf, Lily noticed something peculiar. A book she hadn’t seen before was tucked away at the very back, almost hidden behind a stack of fairy tales. It was a very odd-looking book indeed. The cover was a bright, electric blue and instead of a picture, there was a big, swirling blob of something that looked like multi-coloured spaghetti. Above the blob, in a font that wiggled like jelly, were the words: "Adventures with Gloop."

Lily carefully pulled the book off the shelf. She looked around to see if Mrs. Higgins was nearby, because the book felt… strange. Like it was giggling. And it sort of was. A faint, almost-silent *giggle, giggle* seemed to be coming from the pages. Lily, usually shy around anything new, hesitated. But the book kept giggling.

Finally, her curiosity won. She carried it over to her favourite beanbag chair and sat down, carefully placing the book on her lap. When she opened it, a puff of glitter exploded in her face! Lily giggled too, brushing the glitter off her nose.

The story inside wasn't quite a story, she quickly discovered. It was mostly pictures. Big, bold, vibrant pictures. And the thing that was in the pictures, that must be Gloop! He was… a monster. But not a scary monster. Gloop was a jumble of colours and shapes. He had three googly eyes, one above the other, a mouth that looked like a wobbly, pink worm, and arms and legs that were made of what looked like stretched-out marshmallows.

Gloop was the funniest monster Lily had ever seen.

He was doing all sorts of silly things: tripping over clouds, trying to drink from a rain puddle with a tiny umbrella, and accidentally wearing a giant mushroom on his head like a hat. Lily found herself laughing out loud, the sound echoing through the otherwise quiet library.

As she turned the pages, the *giggle, giggle* from the book grew louder. The pictures seemed to wink at her. Suddenly, a voice, a very high-pitched, bubbly voice, came from the book. "Hello!" it squeaked.

Lily jumped, nearly dropping the book. She looked around. No one else was nearby. Then she looked back at Gloop, and realised the voice had come from him!

"H-hello?" Lily stammered, completely astonished.

"It’s so nice to meet you!" Gloop’s voice chirped from the page. His marshmallow leg wobbled a little as if he were bowing. "I’m Gloop! And you are…?"

"I’m Lily," she whispered, feeling like she was dreaming.

"Lily! That’s a lovely name! Are you having fun reading about me?" Gloop’s wobbly pink mouth turned into a very large, lopsided smile.

"Yes!" Lily exclaimed. "You’re so… funny!"

"I try my best!" Gloop chuckled, his voice like fizzy pop. "Do you like to play games?"

"Yes!" Lily practically shouted.

"Wonderful!" Gloop exclaimed. “How about… Hide-and-Seek?”

And that was how it started. Over the next few weeks, Lily visited Gloop at the library every Tuesday. They would talk through the book. Gloop would ask her questions, and Lily would read out her thoughts and observations. They would play imaginary games together, their giggles echoing through the quiet library. They built marshmallow castles (which always collapsed) and went on silly adventures where Lily helped Gloop navigate upside-down forests and escape grumpy purple clouds that tried to tickle him.

Mrs. Higgins, observing the child and the unusual book, would often smile. One day, she stopped by Lily’s beanbag. "Having fun with your new friend, dear?" she asked kindly, her voice soft.

Lily nodded enthusiastically. "He’s the best friend ever, Mrs. Higgins! He’s a monster, but he’s so friendly!"

Mrs. Higgins smiled. “Some of the best friends are the most unexpected, aren't they?” She patted Lily’s head gently and continued on her way.

However, one Tuesday, something was different. When Lily arrived, Gloop was looking unusually… deflated. His usual vibrant colours seemed a little dull, and his voice was quieter than usual.

"What’s wrong, Gloop?" Lily asked, her voice full of concern.

"I…" Gloop sighed, his marshmallow arm drooping. “I don’t feel so good, Lily.”

“What’s wrong? Are you sad?”

“Not sad,” Gloop replied. “Empty. It’s difficult to explain. I think… I’m running out of giggles.”

Lily frowned. "Running out of giggles?" she repeated, puzzled. "What does that mean?"

"Well," Gloop began, his voice barely a whisper. “Giggles are like… food… or energy. They’re what keep me… me. And there haven’t been many giggles lately.” He sighed again.

Lily looked around at the library. It was quieter than usual. Other children were in different parts of the library, but not many books were being opened, and only a couple of soft murmurs could be heard. There wasn’t as much laughter, as much excitement in the air.

Lily thought hard. Gloop needed giggles to survive. She knew this because when they had met, Gloop had said how his favourite things were stories and laughter. "Wait here," she said urgently, closing the book. "I’ll be right back!"

Lily raced through the library, her heart pounding. She spotted a small group of younger children in the Story Time room. They were looking at some books, but their faces seemed a little bored. An idea sparked in Lily's mind.

She tiptoed into the room, then cleared her throat, which drew their attention.

"Hello, everyone!" she said, feeling a bit nervous. “I have a very silly friend, and he loves stories. And he also loves to laugh. I’d like to tell you his favourite story if that's okay.”

The librarian who had come with the kids gave Lily an encouraging nod. And so, Lily started to tell them the story. It was the story of how she had first met Gloop, but as she went through it she made all kinds of funny voices. She made Gloop have a particularly loud sneeze, she described in vivid detail all of Gloop's mishaps.

She mimicked Gloop's wobbly legs.

She exaggerated his silly outfits. She kept tripping up over her words to match the antics that Gloop did, making it sound all the funnier. And as Lily acted, the children’s faces slowly started to transform from boredom into curiosity, and finally into giggles. Loud, echoing, beautiful giggles that filled the room. Soon everyone, even the grown-ups, were laughing.

As she laughed with the group, Lily felt the giggles growing, and her stomach start to itch with enjoyment. It felt strange but fun. She went into further detail to get the laughter up more!

When she finished the story, the room was filled with a chorus of happy voices. The children asked her more about Gloop, the wonderful, colourful monster that made the story so amazing! Lily thought of this, a plan forming in her mind to brighten up Gloop’s day.

She ran back to the children's section, breathless, and opened the book to Gloop’s page. The moment the pages of the book opened, his colours exploded again, as a strong, sweet smell wafted from within. The faint, almost-silent *giggle, giggle* seemed to have returned, but it was louder, more boisterous than before.

“Lily!” Gloop shouted, his voice full of energy. His marshmallow limbs wiggled with renewed vigour. “I can hear… I can *feel*… the giggles! What happened?”

"I told your story to the Story Time group!" Lily exclaimed, beaming. "And everyone laughed! They loved you, Gloop!"

Gloop practically bounced off the page. His colours shimmered with joy. “You… you shared me with the world! You told my story!”

“You seemed sad," Lily replied. "And it’s no fun to be sad.”

“You are the best friend in the whole wide world, Lily!” Gloop shouted. “I feel… amazing! Like I could… I could…” He paused. “I could go on an adventure!”

"Let's do it!" Lily said enthusiastically.

And so, that Tuesday, they went on a real adventure.

Gloop, beaming, seemed to stretch out from the book. His colourful form was like a cloud now. It started as an intangible blur but over time slowly formed the recognisable blob. He reached out a marshmallow arm, and Lily’s hand found the gooey soft, and wobbly grip of the soft appendage, ready for an adventure. Lily and Gloop had an epic time travelling to far off lands within their imaginative world. Gloop did some wild stunts, and even did some amazing tricks using Lily's helpful assistance and clever insights. The Library was now filled with constant giggles of Lily and Gloop. Mrs. Higgins, glancing their way, felt a glow of warmth in her heart. They were both having such fun together!
Their special adventures would last for as long as their laughter and their stories. Lily knew that she would always treasure her friend Gloop, and their Tuesday adventures in the quiet, giggling world of the Willow Creek Library.
And every Tuesday after, whenever the time came to open the book. a little burst of laughter always sprang out.
