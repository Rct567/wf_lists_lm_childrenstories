<title>Aubrey's Awesome Adventures Animals Again</title>
<body>
Once upon a time, in a sunny little town called Sunnyville, lived a girl named Aubrey. Aubrey had bright, curious eyes, a smile that could light up a room, and a big, adventurous heart. She loved exploring the world, especially the parts of it that were filled with animals. She had already had many adventures with animals – she'd rescued a lost kitten, helped a bird build its nest, and even taught a clumsy puppy how to fetch!

This time, Aubrey was about to embark on another awesome adventure, and it all started with a letter.

One sunny morning, Aubrey was playing in her garden when a bright yellow envelope landed at her feet. She picked it up, her heart doing a little flutter. It was addressed to her in fancy, swirling letters. “To Aubrey, from Professor Bumble.”

Aubrey knew who Professor Bumble was! He was a famous animal scientist, and she’d read all his books. He always wrote in a way that made science fun! Carefully, she opened the envelope. Inside, there was a note and a small, folded map.

The note read: “Dear Aubrey, I need your help! A curious creature needs assisting! Follow the map, and your adventure awaits. Yours in Animal Kingdom, Professor Bumble.”

Aubrey’s eyes widened. An adventure! She loved solving mysteries and helping animals. Without hesitation, she grabbed her trusty backpack, filled it with a magnifying glass, a notebook, some healthy snacks (apples and carrot sticks!), and a bottle of water. Then, she followed the map.

The map led Aubrey through her familiar Sunnyville streets, past Mrs. Gable’s flower shop and the playground where she often played. Then, it led her further, towards the Whispering Woods. The Whispering Woods got its name because the wind rustled through the leaves, making it sound like the trees were whispering secrets.

Aubrey skipped along the path, her backpack bouncing. The trees grew taller and the sunlight dappled through the leaves. Soon, she reached a small, bubbling stream. The map instructed her to follow the stream upstream.

As she walked, Aubrey listened to the sounds of the woods: the chirping of birds, the buzzing of bees, and the rustling of small animals in the undergrowth. She spotted a fluffy squirrel gathering nuts and a colourful butterfly flitting from flower to flower. It was so exciting to see so much animal life!

After what seemed like a long, exciting walk, the stream led her to a small clearing. And there, nestled beneath a giant oak tree, was… a fluffy little creature.

It was a Pangolin! Aubrey recognised it instantly. The Pangolin was a very unique and gentle animal, covered in tough, overlapping scales, almost like a pine cone. It was curled up into a tiny ball, looking scared and confused.

"Oh, you poor thing," Aubrey said softly. "What's wrong?"

The Pangolin uncurled slightly, its little snout peeking out. It looked up at Aubrey with big, worried eyes.

Aubrey knelt down. "It’s okay. I'm here to help. My name is Aubrey." She spoke in a calming voice. The Pangolin, as if understanding, made a little chirping sound.

Aubrey looked around, searching for clues. Beside the Pangolin lay a small, empty glass bottle. Hmm. And next to the bottle, there was a single, shiny scale. Aubrey remembered from reading Professor Bumble’s books: Pangolins lost scales sometimes when they were unwell. The Professor said they were the only mammals with scales!

“It looks like you're feeling unwell, little one," Aubrey said gently. “Are you hungry or thirsty?”

The Pangolin chirped again, weakly.

“I’ll see what I can do,” Aubrey said. She looked in her backpack. She had water! And... apples. Pangolins don't normally eat apples, but perhaps it might help. She dipped her finger in her water bottle and carefully touched it to the Pangolin's snout.

The Pangolin licked her finger. Then, Aubrey carefully peeled a little bit of the apple and offered it. The Pangolin took it hesitantly, then munched with great delight. Aubrey smiled. This was the start of a solution!

Aubrey remembered Professor Bumble’s notes. Pangolins often had trouble when they got a lack of nutrients. They were often hurt by habitat loss and sometimes even were being hurt by human interactions. She took out her notebook and looked at all her information, cross-referencing what she could find. She really wished she had brought along a supply of ants.

"Let's find you some good food," Aubrey said. "Then we’ll find Professor Bumble, and he will know what to do.”

Aubrey remembered that Pangolins loved ants. Now, how to find ants in the woods? That was her next challenge. She began to investigate the base of the old oak tree. Lifting up little bits of leaf litter and flipping over fallen logs, she finally found an anthill, buzzing with activity.

Very carefully, Aubrey gathered a small handful of ants in a leaf. She brought the leaf to the Pangolin.

"Here you go, little friend," she said. "Some tasty treats for you."

The Pangolin uncurled its little tongue and happily ate the ants. It chirped again, but this time, the sound was more cheerful.

Aubrey smiled. The Pangolin looked a little better already. She knew, from Professor Bumble’s research, that this specific species of Pangolin ate ants and termites, just like these ants. Professor Bumble’s information would guide them towards more advanced assistance, but she felt good she had started the helping journey.

Aubrey realized she still needed to inform Professor Bumble. How? She decided to go back toward the stream, following the map the professor provided. She knew the stream flowed back to Sunnyville. Hopefully, somewhere along the journey back she might see the Professor.

Aubrey packed up the leftover apple. The little Pangolin watched her, following her every move. She looked into its worried eyes and felt even more determined. She couldn’t leave it alone. Aubrey would just take her time, and she started slowly towards the main path and back home.

Suddenly, a noise!

*Scrabble!*

Aubrey looked up. Behind a bush, she saw a flash of red and brown. It was a fox! The fox was looking straight at the Pangolin, its eyes narrowed, as if thinking of it as food.

"Hey!" Aubrey shouted. "Go away!"

The fox paused, surprised. Aubrey stood tall, her arms wide, making herself look as big and brave as she could. The fox glanced at the Pangolin again and decided to find an easier meal. With a flick of its tail, it disappeared back into the undergrowth.

Aubrey sighed with relief. That was close! She knew that pangolins were vulnerable animals because they rolled up when frightened. Unfortunately, they often didn't know when something was dangerous, and this could easily get them eaten. It was important to keep the Pangolin safe, and find more assistance as quickly as possible. She quickly scooped up the little Pangolin and tucked it safely into her backpack, right on the top! It was a bit uncomfortable, but at least it was safe.

She followed the path, walking as fast as she could. The map provided was helpful because she used it to travel near the old bridge which Aubrey often crossed during other adventures. She took another path towards the playground and walked faster still. Finally, she found the outskirts of Sunnyville, closer to Professor Bumble's workshop.

Suddenly, a thought.

"Professor Bumble likes a specific berry. I should leave him a note to show I needed him," she said out loud. Aubrey was talking to herself a lot today, since she had only been spending time with animals, or by herself, lately.

She walked into a small garden by the playground, grabbed a pen, and carefully tore off the edge of a notepad. She quickly wrote the Professor a note and taped it to the berries. Then, she rushed away, ready for what could be her last leg of adventure!

Then, Aubrey heard a voice call out, "Aubrey! Is that you?"

It was Professor Bumble! He came hurrying out of his workshop, his eyes sparkling with excitement. He waved a jar with ants, too!

"Aubrey! What an adventure, I see! Excellent work, and you found my berry message! Let's help this little one!"

He gently took the Pangolin from Aubrey’s backpack. The Pangolin, safe in Professor Bumble’s arms, uncurled and chirped happily.

Professor Bumble examined the Pangolin carefully. He confirmed the Pangolin was lacking certain nutrients and that he probably had trouble eating, given his current weakness. He got ready to use the ants to provide much-needed nutritional help, and he turned to Aubrey.

"My dear Aubrey, you are a true animal friend," Professor Bumble said, beaming. "You followed the map, kept our friend safe, and knew just what to do. Now, the Pangolin will be fine!"

Together, Aubrey and Professor Bumble cared for the Pangolin. Professor Bumble had special food and the knowledge to help the Pangolin feel better. Aubrey stayed by the Pangolin’s side, bringing more food, and watching her get healthy again. The Professor set up a small temporary home. Within a few days, the Pangolin had regained all her scales. She was able to stand up by herself and explore.

Once the Pangolin was healthy again, Professor Bumble and Aubrey, both ready and eager, went on another exciting adventure. Professor Bumble said, “Pangolins are vulnerable to extinction because of loss of habitat. We must return her to her habitat”. So they found a nice safe space near the original habitat that was far away from human civilization, and after many goodbyes, they set her loose. The Pangolin was so happy to see a new home again! Aubrey said she was sorry to see her friend go, but that it was an absolute thrill to do so much good!

“I am happy to say, my dear Aubrey,” Professor Bumble stated “you are an amazing friend, and you showed great potential for wildlife rescue and improvement.”

Aubrey felt a warm feeling in her chest, filled with joy. It felt good to help, and she loved knowing the Pangolin was now safe. They went back to Sunnyville, where Professor Bumble had organized an outdoor party. The sun shone. Aubrey laughed.

From then on, Aubrey had many more awesome adventures. She kept helping animals, always remembering her adventure with the Pangolin, the fox, the berries, and Professor Bumble. Aubrey knew that with kindness, courage, and a love for animals, she could do anything, again and again! And, she looked forward to even more exciting adventures in the future. And as the sun set, Aubrey dreamt of her next animal adventure.
