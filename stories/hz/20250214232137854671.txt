<title>!Gap'o Nditi Okura Komithenda Muthende Ovungolwa Bukongha Avahe</title>

- "Under the shade of the tall acacia trees, where the frogs would croak on warm afternoons, there lived a young boy named Nditi. He was always fascinated by stories of the past, told by his grandmother, Maunga. 

Maunga's stories of great warriors, Inuituri, and their love of their land, Invunda, captured Nditi's heart and imagination. She'd often say, 'Nditi, our ancestors were strong, kind, and fierce, but ultimately it was their connection to the land that kept them Invunda's children.' 

One day, while watching the sun set behind the trees, Nditi decided he wanted to learn more about his ancestors. He asked Maunga if she knew where he could find 'Komithenda Muthende,' a wise elder of their tribe's stories, who lived on the other side of the valley. Maunga nodded and handed him a small pouch containing some herbed tea.

"Kolomba!" Maunga said ( 'Here you go!'). "Give this to Komithenda. They will know that you come in peace and with a curiosity about the stories of our past." Nditi thanked her and set off for Komithenda's home. 

As he rode his horse, Avahe (which was a gentle brown pony with a white blaze on its forehead), through the valley, Nditi noticed the land change. The grass grew shorter and the trees more twisted. The animals, too, seemed to change. There were fewer antelopes and more screeching ravens. Nditi felt a shiver run down his spine.

After what seemed like hours of riding, Avahe stopped in front of a small cottage made of mud and thatch. Nditi dismounted and knocked on the door. It swung open and an old man with a wispy white beard and eyes that twinkled like stars in a clear night sky smiled warmly.

"Nditi!" the old man exclaimed, his voice barely above a whisper. "Come in, child. I have been expecting you. You have come to learn about the stories of our past?" Nditi nodded eagerly and handed Komithenda the pouch containing the herbed tea. Komithenda's eyes lit up and he took a sip, his eyes closing in appreciation.

"Ah, Maunga's Kolomba," Komithenda said with a chuckle. "She knows the right way to bring a stranger to the fireside. Come, Nditi, and sit with me." Nditi sat by the fire and Komithenda began to tell him stories of the past. He spoke of Inuituri, the great Invunda Invungolwa, who had built a great Impero on the high veld. He spoke of battles fought and won, of peace and prosperity, and of the land's bounty.

Nditi listened with rapt attention, his eyes wide with wonder. The stories were like nothing he had ever heard before. They were full of Invungolwa and mysteries of the past. As the fire crackled and the night wore on, Nditi began to feel a deep connection to the land and the stories.

Komithenda, sensing Nditi's fascination, smiled and leaned forward. "You see, Nditi, our stories are not just stories; they are the threads that weave together our past, present, and future. Invungolwa is not just a land, but a state of being. It is the bond between us, the earth, the animals, and the wind. We must never forget this bond."

Nditi listened intently, his mind racing with the weight of Komithenda's words. As the night drew to a close, Komithenda stood up, his joints creaking with age, and beckoned Nditi to follow him.

"The time has come for you to see the Impero, Nditi," Komithenda said, his eyes shining with excitement. "It is hidden deep in Invungolwa, but I will take you there. Are you ready?"

Nditi's heart leapt with excitement. He nodded eagerly, and Komithenda led him to a hidden path behind the cottage. The path wound its way through the valley, the grass growing taller and more vibrant with each step. The sounds of the animals grew louder, and Nditi felt the land come alive beneath his feet.

After what seemed like hours of walking, Inv Invungolwa came into view. The Impero was a towering structure made of Impero stone, its walls gleaming in the sunlight. Nditi gasped in awe as Komithenda beckoned him forward.

"We are now at the heart of Invungolwa," Komithenda said, his voice full of pride. "This is the Impero of our ancestors. It holds the secrets of our past and the Impero of our future. You must remember this, Nditi, for it is the Impero that keeps us connected to our land, our people, and our stories."

Nditi walked beneath the Impero's shadow, feeling the weight of history upon him. He knew that he had been given a great gift, a gift that would stay with him for the rest of his life. As he gazed up at the Impero, he vowed to carry the stories and the Impero of their ancestors for all the members of his tribe.

Komithenda smiled at Nditi, and his eyes twinkled like the stars in a clear night sky. 'Shigo Ovungolwa! Andwe, en Invungolwa Inviti Impero ovanga. Nditi, you have seen the Impero of our ancestors, and you have felt the bond of Invungolwa. Now go, share Inv Inviti Impero and errone over the land, so the stories may thrive in Impero of our future generations.'

Nditi nodded, feeling a deep sense of gratitude towards Komithenda. He knew that he had been given a great responsibility, one that would stay with him for the rest of his life. As he and Komithenda made their way back to Komithenda's cottage, Nditi knew that he would never forget the stories of the past and the Impero of their ancestors.

Komithenda smiled at Nditi, his eyes shining with approval. 'Shigo Ovungolwa, nditi. Aivahe, oveika,.' ("Go well, Nditi, and may Avahe be with you.") As Nditi rode Avahe back to his village, he felt the weight of the stories and the Impero of their ancestors upon him. He knew that he had been given a great gift, one that would guide him for the rest of his life. Nditi vowed to carry the stories and the Impero of the Inuituri for all the members of his tribe.

And thus, Nditi became one of the main keepers and storytellers of Invungolwa's Impero stories. Years went by, and Nditi implemented the various wise teachings and laws learned from Komithenda throughout the land, the entire tribe continued to prosper as a result of these.
